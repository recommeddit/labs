54001,"I love the bath and sleep ideas, but I just want to share with everybody else that there is [no link between vitamin c and a pre-established cold](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/06/050628064753.htm). However, there is probably a link between prevention, especially when exposed to extreme conditions."
54002,"And (I reply in a cartoonishly huffy tone) had I meant vitamin c I would have said vitamin c.

My regimen is very specific: begin drinking a half gallon of orange juice in the morning and spend the day drinking it until it's gone.

I make no mention of vitamin c, so I find myself cartoonishly huffy that you would bring it up at all."
54003,"That's generally the pseudo science reasoning, my apologies."
54004,"I can verify from personal experience.  When I feel a cold coming on, I take a ton of vitamin C (5-6 pills, many times the recommended daily dose) and ONE dose of Zinc.  That usually helps mitigate the oncoming cold, and keeps it from slipping into bronchitis for me.  Doesn't do anything when the cold's already hit, though."
54005,"That's confirmation bias. ""I feel a cold coming on"" = onset of cold. Vitamin C only works if you don't have the virus in your system yet."
54006,"I know it isn't worth much for proof, but before I started doing that, I got bronchitis once a year.  Since I started four years ago, I haven't had a cold move into bronchitis.  The vitamin C might prevent a secondary infection from starting up that causes the bronchitis.  And I remember reading that at least zinc helped end a cold sooner if taken early during the course of infection."
54007,"1) Hot toddy: Rum, whiskey, brandy, lemon, orange, boiling water, and cinammon.

2) Neti Pot."
54008,I assume you don't put the hot toddy IN the neti pot...
54009,Insanity wolf says you assume wrong
54010,"My hot toddy recipe is slightly different: whiskey, hot water, lemon juice, honey and then steep a a bag of early grey tea in it.  

Feels good man."
54011,I <3 my Neti Pot
54012,I have the worst luck.  I got a sinus infection that lasted for months after using my Neti Pot for a simple cold.  Keep it super clean!
54014,Just buy distilled water. 99cents
54015,I do it wrong. I almost drown when I use it.
54016,"Why do hot toddies work? Doesn't alcohol dehydrate?

I always see this suggested, so I don't doubt the efficiency. I just need to know the mechanics of it."
54017,"Its hot, so it drains the sinuses.  Plus, if you make it right, you drink about 4 oz. of whiskey.  So the heat drains the sinuses a little and the whiskey gets you drunk, so you don't care!"
54018,bartender here: you're missing cloves and honey
54019,"ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET: Drink hot water or tea every hour, on the hour, until your pee is clear. Repeat until sickness disappears. Seriously. 

And yes, I'm Chinese.

EDIT: I'm not sure exactly why this works, but I'm sure it has something to do with flushing your system of the virus, and also water thins mucus so it's easier to clear."
54020,Eating chicken noddle soup while watching the Price is Right.
54021,"Gargle salt water!! It sounds weird but works wonders. 

Drink lots of clear fluids, too, and avoid dairy."
54022,"I totally agree.  Definitely avoid dairy if you're already congested.  IT just makes the mucus thicker.

  And drink water until you think you might die from an overdose.  Your nose will be less stuffy, that annoying post nasal drip will disappear, and coughing will be easier.


Also sleep.  The time you can be complaining or half-heartedly doing work, you might as well sleep and then wake up a bit better each time."
54023,Is there any science to back up the dairy-mucus connection? That's pretty interesting.
54024,Nope and apparently it's quite debatable.  But I know for me some things make me more noticeably more congested and dairy is one of them.
54025,neat
54026,Sleep is key!!
54027,it doesnt sound weird at all... in fact many doctors actually prescribe it for a bad throat.
54028,"Tear gas. Seriously.  Not sure howd youd plan this, maybe go to an occupy protest. But the tear gas will make all that shit just run out of your face."
54029,I went to boot camp in the middle of a very cold Chicago winter. I was sick the entire time up until the last two weeks after we went through the gas chamber. I had enough snot and gunk to fill a bowl.
54030,I had exactly this same experience.
54031,"Take some dayquil during the day.
Take some nyquil during the night.
Don't complain and live your life normally!
It's just a cold."
54032,"In other words, quit being a pussy"
54033,Apt username; not bad advice.
54034,"Normally I take a Mucinex and then an hour or 2 later take a really hot shower (there has to be a lot of steam) and put your face by the stream of water and breathe in the steam. Then blow your nose while in the shower. Every time I get congested I do this and it clears me up pretty good. 
Wow this kind of sounds disgusting now that I read it..."
54035,It's pretty crazy when you have a big thick stream of mucus that reaches from your nose all the way to the shower floor and just sort of hangs there as you breathe in through your mouth to give it another blow.  Very satisfying.
54036,"Sweat it out.    
    
At night I pile on all my comforters and warm blankets, drink a shit-ton of water, put another glass on my nightstand and snuggle in to a ridiculously uncomfortable sleep.  The next morning I feel disgusting so I jump in the shower and change my sheets then depending on how I feel the next night I do it again. The most important part of my remedy is to stay hydrated."
54037,"This is my thing too.  But I add some insanely hot foods, chili most often, and night quil.  

My wife hates it.  Says I say some weird stuff in my sleep.  But 80% of the time it works every time."
54038,"Vitamin D.  The common cold is strongly associated with deficiencies of Vitamin D.  It takes a while to build up, so it isn't much good at first, but it can help you heal and avoid getting sick again."
54039,"This. Seventy gorillian upvotes for you, sir. Haven't seen a doctor in 4 years due to lengthy flu after starting vitamin D. Most of the times it goes away in a day or three."
54040,Wash your hands before you eat; don't rub your eyes or pick your nose; keep your distance from sick people. Better luck next time.
54041,"Paracetamol - Only if I'm in pain

Any decongestant - If I have a runny nose

And my special flu drink: 3/4 Glass of warm water. 1/6 Glass of honey. 1 Lemon - squeeze the pulp out into the drink. Garlic - chop finely and crush into drink.

Drink this once when you wake up and right before bed. Eat the garlic, the honey takes the edge off it. This not only fights the cold, it also soothes your throat and prevents the cold from getting worse. 

I would personally recommend this everyday and not only when you have a cold."
54042,This one intrigues me.  Writing it down for future use.
54043,"5 - 10 white castles. Depending on 
my stomach."
54044,"Vitamin c bomb it...tomato juice or vegetable juice, plenty of OJ (preferably the good, not from concentrate crap), and some chicken soup or broth.  Repeat as necessary."
54045,I simply take Vitamin C tablets.
54046,Please tell me. My cold is giving way to bronchitis. I'm fucking miserable.
54047,"As a Chef I have learned about the medical properties  of some foods.
My mix is Equal parts Lemon Juice (Real lemon)+ grated Ginger+ Cayenne pepper + Honey
Lemon juice = Lots of Vitamin C
Ginger = Immune system boost, helps with tummy aches. (mongoose chew ginger after being bit from snakes)
Cayanne = Clears the sinuses 
Honey = Antiseptic with energy boost 
Hope it helps"
54048,"1. I immediately stop drinking coffee, which basically makes me sleepy 24/7. 
2. Next, I switch it up to mostly honey/lemon tea (fresh).
3. Start drinking about half a gallon of water per day
4. Hot soups (as hot as I can tolerate)
5. Take a hot shower at least once a day 
6. If I am not eating, peeing, showering, I am napping/sleeping.
7. I take limited cold medicine during the process (only if I have to be somewhere). Many cold symptoms are caused by your body trying to heal itself. 

In 2-3 days (from first sign), everything except the cough is usually gone."
54049,Cant tell if really good ideas or genius ideas.
54050,Drink until the cold goes away. That way you won't remember it when it's over so it will feel like it never happened to begin with. This is how I deal with all my problems.
54053,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town

Waiting for someone or something to show you the way..."
54054,"Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 

And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 

No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun."
54055,So we are in agreeance. Pink Floyds’ music is a good remedy for most ailments.
54056,">No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

Such a great line amongst many fantastic ones."

54060,"Unless I'm really contagious or it's some kind of stomach virus or something where any kind of movement produces projectile vomit, I find that the best way to feel better is to get out of bed and do something/go somewhere. Lying in my own sickness just makes me feel worse, but fresh air and light movement make me feel much better.  I usually take a couple ibuprofen and some hand sanitizer and go window shopping or to the park or something."
54061,"I tend to do this because I don't like sitting around. Ultimately, at the end of the day, it makes me feel a lot worse."
54062,"tea, and hot and sour soup."
54063,"If you have a headache, pinch the nerve between your thumb and index finger really hard for five minutes. It helps in some people to alleviate head pain."
54064,headache vs pinched nerve?? hmmm
54065,It really doesn't hurt after you let the pressure go
54066,lots of soup. curry and oranges oranges oranges
54067,"I eat ramen, drink lots of water, overmedicate, and sleep.  Any possible time I can be sleeping I curl up in my bed and sleep.  I think just letting my body fight it without giving it anything else to do helps a lot."
54068,I like Tim Ferriss's list of [cold remedies](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/18/4-anti-cold-cocktails-that-work-from-ancient-china-to-german-alcoholics-and-modern-labs/). The ginger and orange peel remedy is the one that seems to always work for me.
54069,Water and steam.
54070,Vicks 44 or Night/Dayquil and Green Tea with honey.
54071,"Tea, tissues, teddy bear. Then more tea."
54072,"Hot toddies. Mine are simple, super hot black tea and whiskey or cherry brandy. Drink at least three a night until cold is gone."
54073,"I'm going to assume that by cold you mean extremely severe cold-like allergy symptoms and not an actual virus, because that's what I'm experienced with.

1. 1-6 benadryl depending on severity of symptoms
2. Afrin
3. Neti Pot
4. Bed.

I also find eating ice cream or something else that is cold to be temporarily soothing, if it doesn't actually help with symptoms. Don't discount alcohol or weed. Sure won't do anything to help but you won't notice as much."
54074,Tea and Vick's Vaporub on your chest/throat area and upper lip (right under your nose)
54075,"Tea, lots and lots and lots of tea."
54076,Sleepytime Tea and sleepy time.
54077,orange tea with 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar and honey
54078,"Take a shot glass add
one part honey,one part lemon juice and two parts preferred brand of hot sauce that is well hot.Stir with a toothpick and chug as much of it as you can in one gulp."
54079,"Drink a lot of water, as in good 3+ litres per day. 

First day, eat only fresh fruit and veges. Avoid dairy like the plague. Go for a run/other strenuous cardio exercise. Keep going until you sweat, keep going some more until you are dripping with sweat, keep going until you are nearly dead from exhaustion, then turn around and run back home again. 

Once home, drink more water, eat more fruit and veges, have a good 15+ minute very hot shower, go to bed, sleep for 10+ hours. 

Wake up in the morning - what cold?"
54080,Hmmm... green tea with lemon and honey. Speed and or sleep. Mostly sleep.
54081,Wait till it goes away. You can do nothing else. HTFU.
54082,"1) as you start to feel sick, take Airborne
2) drink as much Pedialyte (orange kind) as possible.  it really does help.
3) NetiPot"
54083,"water and fever.
Fever goes up, bring it down. Then let it go up again. And then bring it down. Just try not to let it get too high, and your cold leaves faster.

also, it only works if you have a fever"
54084,honey lemon tea
54085,"Vicks Vaporub. That stuff cures everything... colds, flu, stubbed toes, depression, the plague, leprosy... everything!"
54086,"* Try to eat mostly raw food (like fruit and vegetables).
* Hydrate yourself like an animal. Then piss like an animal.
* Get out into the sun (mostly exposed, if you can) for 10-15 minutes a day.
* Get a lot of sleep.
* Take regular showers.
* Laugh. It is known to help with sickness.
* Vitamin C, and Colloidal Silver
* Rub garlic on the bottom of your feet every 6 hours or so.
* Gargle salt water to help with sore throats.
* While Pseudoephedrin may help with getting rid of the symptoms temporarily, it will not heal your cold. The reason you are suffering symptoms is because your body is clearing itself out. If you take Pseudoephedrin to take away symptoms, your body will not heal as fast, and may get worse in the long run (depending on the dosage).
* Wash your hands and face a lot.
* Abstain from junk food."
54087,Magic tea.
54088,"I personally just go through my day best I can, I suck on some cold candy when I can and drink copious amounts of water. But for my friends and loves ones I usually time to make them my family's classic neck bone and radish soup. It obviously has neck bones and radish in it but also green onions, a lot of sliced ginger, MSG, salt, white pepper, and sesame oil. 

I make a pretty large pot of it to keep all day. With some bread or crackers or rice its great. Along with this, lots and lots of fluids. Hot baths. Relaxing music. Sunlight. Rest."
54089,"I usually blow my nose out, as often I can when it's in the ""running"" phase which lasts for three days max. Though your nose will turn red and sore from it, do not swallow any phlegm that you cough up. spit it out immediately. All that blowing will make you dehydrated, so remember to drink water.

If you clear your nose and throat a lot during the initial days, I've found the cold to vanish much faster. and of course, drink only warm water."
54090,"This will get buried but it works. 

Hot food. Nothing kills a cold or sinus infection faster for me than eating very very spicy food."
54091,"take a hot shower 3 times a day, and try to blow as much mucous out of your nose as possible. The hot water will make it go runny in your sinuses and it will come out in handfuls. It is absolutely fucking disgusting, but it washes right off and then you get out with clean sinuses.

I do this because I don't like taking drugs for minor sicknesses, I don't like their side effects."
54092,"In all honesty, I just take Buckleys. It taste awful, but it really does work."
54093,"This response needs to be higher. Buckley's works, if you can survive it."
54094,I'm actually one of those weirdos that doesn't mind the taste. xD
54095,"Smoke weed erryday. Seriously, I haven't been sick in two years."
54096,Tom Yum soup.
54097,"A nice glass of Vernors, a warm blanket, and hot soup is all I've ever needed."
54098,"Whiskey, Gatorade and multi-vitamins."

If this doesn't work, lots of tea :)"
54107,"I have what I call the ""Exam booster""

Figured it out a few years back when I was really sick during exams, Basically Dayquil and an Energy drink."
54108,Spicy foods.
54109,"when you start to feel it in the back of the throat, take some vit c and avoid the whole thing altogether."
54110,Wine and sleep.
54111,"A glass of overproof Kentucky bourbon, Neat. Kills the bacteria? Who knows, makes me feel better."
54112,I go out and get blind drunk. When my hangover goes away it usually takes the cold with it.
54113,"I always sweat them out. Hot soup, hot chocolate, hot everything. Then I climb into bed w/ a comforter and a couple thin fleece blankets. (Those fuckers get hot fast!) I rarely get sick but when I do it only lasts three days tops."
54114,"I get drunk, no smoking, no eating. Wake up rejuvinated!"
54115,A shot of dark rum and a lot of complaining
54116,Drink a lot of 'Naked' drinks that are super high in Vitamin A and C.
54118,"It's tough but if you want to cure it fast, sweat it out under the blankets. If you have sun out, wear your jacket outside and roast yourself. All this while drinking lots of water. You'll be fine in 2 days if you can keep this up.  
  
Stay away from computers, tvs, etc. and just get some good rest."
54119,"when you feel it coming on, get a minimum of 1000 mg of vitamin C, 64 oz of water, and 8 hours of sleep a day. within 2 days the early symptoms subside and you will have fought off the cold."
54120,Take four shots of Sambuca. Then go to sleep. You'll thank me later.
54121,The spiciest of spicey foods.
54122,"Never take medicine and rarely wash hands, *knowing that the additional bacteria you're being exposed to will give your immune response more breadth*. Then, when you're hit with a cold, refuse to take anything for it except maybe some orange juice, and *convince* yourself that your bad-ass immune system is throwing the table at your infection. I haven't had a serious cold in the last ten years, and what colds I've had were hardly an inconvenience."
54123,Half a bottle of Nyquil followed by an 18-hour coma.
54124,"Garlic, not really a secret though. More of a fact."
54125,Fresh ginger boiled in water with some loose leaf green or black tea and lots of honey and lime is also the perfect medicine for a bad chest (I'm guessing I'm not the only smoker who gets bad chests with colds?). The ginger does wonders for chest. If you've never tried it then give it a go. The stronger the better.
54126,"Listerine.  When you feel a cold a coming, nothing works better."
54127,Ginger tea with a tiny splash of lemon and some honey.

54130,"Not so secret...

**Prevention**: Take vitamin D every day. Double your dosage as soon as it gets cold enough for you to not want to go outside. Wash hands often. Do not touch face with hands.

**Treatment** (AKA, weathering it really, there's no treatment): Hit the drugs hard and hit them fast. The second you feel like there's something other than a momentary congestion going on, hit the anti-histamines. Follow the dosage religiously until symptoms disappear even if you feel lots better before. Same with the aches and painkillers (Ibuprofen works better than Acetaminophen for me). Lay down as comfortably as you can. Stay hydrated and FED (starve a cold is bullshit), and most importantly: REST. As in sleep. Use as little energy as possible while your body is fighting the virus (movies, books, videogames and NYQUIL are great with this)."
54131,Hand lotion and a bottle of jack
54132,Zicam. That shit kicks ass. Plus there's different kinds for whatever symptoms you have.
54133,"* oranges

54134,"-Zinc.  Chelated zinc.  Get it at whole foods, or whatever grocery store.

-Garlic.  Chop up 4 or 5 cloves of garlic a day, eat it raw.  Wash it down with a lot of water if necessary.  It's nasty, but it helps.

These two things are a godsend."
54135,"So true story - peppermint is a natural anti inflammatory and anti-mucous!!! Mug of hot water + just a couple of drops of peppermint extract (can be found with the spices and vanilla at the grocery store) = awesome vaporizer! Just breathe in the steam and enjoy!

54142,"Exercise, I weight-lift six days a week and cardio 3 days a week. I haven't been sick in 6 years since I started working out.

I think I read somewhere it helps boosts your white blood cell count/immune system or something."
54143,"You do not want a ""boosted immune system"" - your immune system attacks invaders, however with a heightned immune system response, your immune system turns on itself, viewing parts of your body as the invader. This is called an ""autoimmune disease."" Here is an example: One theory regarding Chron's disease is a heigned immune response of a type of cell (I forget now).

54149,Ha! That's pretty funny
54150,"sleep, plenty of fluids, and heated rooms."
54151,Sleep and Buckley's Mixture.
54152,"Colds are all about symptom management. For each symptom, there is a simple remedy. For nasal congestion, hot soup always clears me out. For sore throat + throat congestion, gargle hot water mixed with saltwater. Vicks vaporub is effective as well as a nice shot of alcohol. Drinky plenty of fluids, consume fruits for essential nutrition, and keep active."
54153,Alka-seltzer cold and flu. That stuff is fucking magnificent. I have sinus problems all the time and alka-seltzer fixes them 100%.
54154,"Research has debunked this but I swear everytime I feel the symptoms of a cold, I take a shitload of vitamin C, enough to give me diarrhea and the cold is gone by the next day."
54155,That much vitamin c is really bad for you.
54156,Time. 1-2 days is enough. The body copes fine on its own.
54157,"After a few days a hard hit of marijuana will give you about 20 mins of normality again. Enjoy it, it comes right back when it wears off, and won't work again."
54158,"also pot smoke expands in your lungs, acting like an expectorant of you're having problems breaking up mucus. honestly it's not great but usually I spend the entire 48h period of being sick also being stoned off my ass, makes it easier to justify staying in bed watching movies etc"
54159,"The best thing I've found is pseudoephedrine.  When I was a kid and you weren't charged a fortune to see the doctor my dad would take me to see the family doctor and I would get a shot of something that would clear me up instantly for several hours.  Unfortunately, that isn't an option in today's environment."
54160,It is in Canada :)
54161,"Yup. Fortunately I can get it in my state, you just have to show a license so they can track you and make sure you don't start making meth."
54162,Same here.  Meth heads ruined it for all of us.  I feel like a criminal just asking for the medication.
54163,"You realize you used to be able to buy pot,  opium,  opium tincture, alcohol,  and cocaine over the counter and mail order in the US and everything didn't go to shit,  right? 

Lack of understanding of history is amazingly damaging to the human race."
54164,"They're now even locking up the guaifenesin behind the counter. I just have to know, why are all the pharma chemicals used in drug manufacturing also useful for those of us with allergies? I mean, we already have allergies, we don't need this shit making it harder."
54165,"Wait, who is locking up guaifenesin? Unless you mean Mucinex D, which has pseudo in it, I'm not aware of anywhere that does this. Just curious."
54166,"My local pharmacy keeps all of the cough syrup and mucinex behind the counter now because kids were getting high off of it or something. Even Delsym, which doesn't have alcohol in it and is meant for children. 

It pisses me off - now, I have to make sure I get there when the pharmacy is open just to get my allergy meds."
54167,"I would argue that the politicians ruined it for everyone.  Meth heads may have been the pressure they were responding to, but at the end of the day, it was still lawmakers who put pen to paper and passed the 2005 CMEA into law.  They had the option to do nothing.  They had the option to say ""Yes, meth is a problem, but it's not in the spirit of a free country to turn innocent sinus sufferers into collateral damage in the effort to stop meth production.""

But no, they passed the law and the rest of us have to suffer until we can get it repealed."
54168,You can get it in every state. It's a federal thing that tracks how much you buy a much. There are limits on it.
54169,I miss this. I need it right now.
54170,You can still get it but it's a hassle.
54171,Exactly.  It's almost not worth it.
54172,"Hi ... emergency pediatrician here.  Not talking about any person's illness specifically here, but about colds in general.  Brace yourself.  NOTHING REALLY WORKS.    

Pseudphedrine in doses big enough to muck up sleep might make the nasal congestion somewhat better, sometimes lots better.  Fluids are good because of the buckets of snot you are eliminating from your body (= fluid loss) and because you want to keep that stuff nice and runny (not stiff and sticky).  In patients with no contraindications, ibuprofen helps with the headache, the muscle aches and the sore throat.      
So as a professional, what do I do?  Two ounces of scotch, lots of tea, regular ibuprofen for pain, and goooooooood movies.    

Hope this helps ..."
54173,"Do the zinc lozenges work?  And also, my 85 year old grandmother made me put Vicks on the bottom of my baby's feet and cover them with socks when she had pneumonia and was coughing every 10 seconds. I scoffed and did it to appease her but it worked.... What the heck is up with *that*?"
54174,"Re: zinc .... this is a bit controversial.  Zinc has been studied in viral infection, in humans mostly related to diarrheal illness and most commonly in third world settings ... so not in your average over-fed westerner.  It seems that zinc supplementation during diarrhea in previously malnourished kids may have some benefit.  Evidence of that in kids that aren't well nourished is hard to find.  Good studies in upper repiratory tract infections is also hard to find.  Zinc overdoses can happen ... so .... no idea if it works or not.  Don't use them myself."
54175,"I don't know but my mom, my cousin and my grandma used the Vick vaporub on the soles of your feet and it helped. I hope someone comes up with a scientific explanation for that."
54176,"Pharmacist Here. Ditto what the doc said. Rest and fluids are your best friend. 


I'll add Tylenol ( acetaminophen) though, for fever. (no alcohol with it)"
54177,That's what I figured. For me any booze just makes things worse.
54178,A
54179,Popsicles and mint tea sounds great actually!
54180,"And ibuprofen is not one of the NSAIDs that will fuck up your liver if taken with alcohol?  I know acetaminophen/paracetamol does and aspirin doesn't, but I can never remember with naproxen and ibuprofen.

Aspirin is the only one that seems to work for me anyway, so I suppose it doesn't matter, but I like to know."
54181,"No.  Ibuprofen might screw up your gut (indigestion and if you are unlucky or very persistent maybe GI bleeds) or your kidney, especially if you are dehydrated when you take it.  I haven't seen major complications to ibuprofen in my 30 years of practice.  Acetaminophen is better known for causing liver problems.  Aspirin is known to cause platelets to fail (probably more effective at this than ibuprofen) which also increases the risk of bleeding.  Naproxen isn't an over the counter drug here in Canada (that I know of) so I am less familiar with its common side effects."
54182,Aleve is Naproxen.  It's probably OTC there.
54183,Of course!  Not generally a PEDs drug so I am less aware of it.  Thanks for the correction.
54184,"Rest, staying warm (especially when your body goes into fever to burn out the virus), relaxation, eating light, easily-digested meals (not over-salted canned soup, though), staying hydrated, getting plenty of zinc and vitamin C, and treating your symptoms (which reduces the stress on your body and therefore can shorten the duration of the cold) with cough syrup."
54185,Sudafed
54186,"Chicken noodle soup, plenty of sleep, and lots of water."
54187,"Lots of sleep, lots of exercise, lots of water, and 100% well balanced nutritious food.

If you do this all the time you'll probably even get sick less often."
54188,Time
54189,"A hot toddy made by my favorite bartender.  A heavy shot of bourbon, juice of half a lemon, a packet of sugar steamed with an espresso machine and served in a brandy snifter.  Put your face over it and inhale, then drink it slowly.  You will feel instantly better and by the time you sober up, your cold is gone."
54190,Drinking tea and cuddling with a puppy on a comfy couch watching horrible movies that you would normally never own up to liking.
54191,the cold symptoms are almost better than some of these cures
54192,I find a big bowl of hot and sour soup does wonders for clearing up the congestion.
54193,Drinking a lot of water.
54194,"Plenty of water to stay hydrated. Eating enough because the body needs food for energy and for fighting off the cold virus. 
Clearing out my nose/sinuses gets more of the gunk that is has the virus in it will help me get better faster.

54195,"elderberry, cordyceps, rhodiola, panax gensing. tea made with chamomile, lemon, ginger and cinnamon and honey, tastes like shit but i swear it works"
54196,I'm all about the herbal teas. I second that!!
54198,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymetazoline

Oxymetazoline, in the form of nasal sprays.  Stuff is fantastic, clears up nasal passages in a few minutes."
54199,Dat chicken noodle soup
54200,"I ate a spoonful of minced garlic once, and the next day I felt way better."
54201,"Hot beverages, preferably non caffeinated. That includes a ton of herbal teas. I make my own with a ton of spices to help recovery. I like to put ginger, some pepper corns, orange rinds, lemon juice, honey, cinnamon, cloves, and drink them by the bucket all day long and night. Yes, that'll make you pee a whole lot, and that's good. I also add garlic, but that's for the super-human apparently, because my husband runs away if I ever insinuate to put some garlic in his drink when he's sick. It is supposed to help with any sort of infection so I put two mashed cloves in mine. Sweetened with honey you won't even notice it there."
54202,1000mg of vitamin C every 4 hours.  Breathe-right nose strips.  Vicks.  Lots of pillows to prop me up. Netflix.  Kleenex with lotion.  All these things are required.
54203,"Hot lemon and real, raw, unpasteurized honey. The honey is the most important part! Can't stress that enough. 
That and enough weed to make sleeping it off easy as pie."
54204,my life
54205,Otrivin or a nose spray of another brand really helps
54206,"Go to a Jewish deli and get real chicken soup, go to whole foods and get lots organic unfiltered apple juice go home and put on two layers of everything, a hat too. Eat the soup, drink the juice and stay under a blanket or three. The juice will empty you and the soup will give you nutrients. The heat will make the whole thing go faster.  It's like three days of sick rolled into one."
54207,"A cup of chicken soup, a cup of orange juice, a cup of hot tea with lemon and honey, and a cup of peppermint tea. All washed down by water. Take an antihistamine, and a couple ibuprofen. Sleep as much as possible and eat something light. Wrap up warm. All good!"
54208,Your immune system.
54209,Zinc. It's the thing that you really want. Start pounding them whenever you start feeling sick.
54210,"Hot water, gin, lemon, honey. Tastes awful, but you need to drink it while it's hot. Works a lot better than Vick's Vaporub on the soles of your feet."
54211,"Vegetable soup (Minestrone or something). Getting as much nutrition as you can definitely helps.

After that take some Nyquil or Tylenol PM to go to sleep and let your body take care of itself.

If you're thirsty, drink some Gatorade."
54212,"Echinacea works everytime for me, I haven't been sick in almost 3 years, no flu vaccines either just pure echinacea pills whenever I feel something coming on."
54213,Suicide. Cold is gone in a flash.
54214,Most metal answer right here.
54215,"Depending on the severity of the cold working out helps.  If it is a chest cold though forget that get better.  Eating food/more food than normal evening though I don't feel like it.  The body is in overdrive/repair mode and working out and eating plenty of food helps tremendously with recovery.  The obvious ones, drink plenty of water, sleep more, mucinex or good old pseudoephedrine."
54216,You should mention that working out during a cold can create a serious heart weakness. It's generally not a good idea
54217,Never had a problem.  I get a cold and go to the gym cold is gone in less than 36 hours.  Know your body it works for me and that was the question.
54218,Even if you didn't have there is a risk for a heart infection and you really should not give this advice
54219,So are you a foot doctor or something?  GTFO
54220,Numerous studies have been done to back up that exact piece of information so until you have a PhD and have done the years of research why don't you take your own advice and not give any
54221,Cuddling boa constrictors.
54222,"Marijuana. Clears out the sinuses, makes you feel better/no headach. If your throat hurts you can take it in a tea form, with some honey. Had a cold a few weeks ago, coming in on a friday morning, and gone by sunday."
54223,Theraflu: Severe Cold/Flu
54224,Fuck yeah. That stuff works wonders.
54225,sambucus. you can findit at a vitamin shop.
54226,you can take day or night quil for symptoms but the sambucus will help get rid of it
54227,Will have to look into that have tried pretty well every drug possible.
54228,"a little bit of black tea extract ""im talking like 90/10 or 95/10 will help even more but you dont need to go that far."
54229,"Anything you can still buy containing pseudoephedrine who’s relief lasts 12 hours.

Anything that makes someone trying to sleep and get well should not have to wake every 4-hours to take medicine. It is a scam!

Looking at you, NyQuil."
54230,I’m gonna be honest I’ve just been taking Ativan to keep me knocked out this flu/cold is so bad. So yeah I feel that with the neo citron.
54231,"Sudafed, the real stuff behind the counter. Does a very good job, and doesn't put me in a fog like a lot of the other stuff. I take NyQuil when I've already accepted that for the next 24 hours, I'll be asleep for the next 12 of them, and hazy for the 12 after."
54232,For me it’s the Neo citron for cold extra strength night time honey lemon tea.
54233,"Vitamin C effervescent tablets, as soon as you start to feel symptoms, To me it's like the body equivalent of diverting power to the main deflector shields!"
54234,"It'll depend on how your symptoms manifest. I have terrible sinuses, so I get crazy congestion and I rely on Maximum Strength Mucinex-D. That shit is like magic but it's insanely strong so they only let you buy it every 6 weeks or so (at least in my state). Honestly, I've found that staying away from ""all in one"" medications and instead targeting my specific symptoms is what works best for me. I'll usually end up taking a pain reliever and a decongestant. Just be sure that if you're mixing medications, you keep an eye on the acetaminophen content, since it is possible to overdose if you overdo it.

If you're up for it, neti pot nasal rinses are amazing and disgusting all at once. You basically shoot water up your nose into your sinuses and drain everything that's up there. It's weird at first and sounds really hippy-dippy but will seriously make you feel amazing. Also be sure that you're staying hydrated! I usually go with hot water with a little bit of honey, lemon, and ginger when I'm sick."
54235,I am a big fan of plain old pseudophedrine HCI (not the name brand Sudaphed) for anything sinus related. Just don't take it for too many days in a row and drink lots of water.
54236,This and dristan nasal spray are staples in my home. I hate nasal congestion.
54237,"It's such a  hippie/home remedy type situation but everyone at my office SWEARS by this. Oil of Oregano. It's SO disgusting but you can get caplets that are not so bad. I swear to god, it's a miracle."
54238,"When I get a head cold, that is more often than not accompanied with a sore throat, I get a decongestant,Mucinex or a generic brand, and take some sort of pain reliever. This combination helps to get all of the snot out and the pain reliever can help with over all aches and pains. Don't go for any of that high in vitamin C crap you'll just be wasting your money, you cannot cure a cold, you can only make the symptoms bearable until you ride it out.  Hope you find something that works and feel better!"
54239,"2 things:

- i'm completely unsure if this one actually works or if it's just a placebo, but i always do it when i have a cold. I take a capful of hydrogen peroxide and tip my head and put it in my ear, allowing it to bubble out for a bit. It tickles. After a minute or so I tip my head back upright and drain the excess into the sink. I do the other ear. Someone a long time ago told me that it works for their colds, and ever since I started doing this it seems to shorten the length of my sickness. 

- walgreens brand saline spray. If you're blowing your nose a lot, this is a must. It absolutely saves me from having that raw feeling I used to get after blowing my nose a lot."
54240,"I asked my girfriend this when we first started dating.  She's a doctor and I thought she might have a miracle cure to share with me.  She said

>It is well known that a cold takes one week to get over if you don't treat it.  But, what we've found is that with the right combination of medications you can get that down to seven days."
54241,"Very true. The only thing that will cure it is time.

You can make yourself more comfortable though. Plenty of fluids (hot, steamy preferably and some decongestants.)

Try some chicken noodle soup with hot sauce in it. That's as a good as any store-bought decongestant."
54242,"I came to post the 7 days to a week comment, but I'll piggy back and expand on yours.  Jewish penicillin  is the way to go.  I make a big batch using a whole chicken, veg, noodles and 4 to 5 times as much garlic and black pepper as you would think to use. 

This will keep you hydrated, fed, and open up the sinuses like draino. Pretty tasty too."
54243,I'm a Sven too!
54244,"Similar to Granny Clampett's (of the Beverly Hillbillies) cure. Take a shot of moonshine every two to four hours, drink plenty of water in between, get rest and in a week or two the cold is licked."
54245,What's her definition of a week? And did her doctorate arrive by mail order?
54246,"> ""The art of medicine consists of keeping the patient amused while nature heals the disease."""
54247,"Sleep. Go to sleep as early as you can. Drink tons of water. Bundle up, rest, limit exercise."
54248,"Yes, limit exercise to just squats, clean and jerks, and maybe 3 or 4 sets of dips.

(Edit: if one comes into my gym to work out, with a full-on cold, I will drown you in the sauna bucket and say you tripped. Everyone will back me up)"
54249,"The problem is that I wake up every two hours at night because I drink too much water. And If I don’t then I’ll wake up because my throat and nose are dry. 

I did get some very good dreams in those 2 hours though."
54250,"Heat kills a virus.  Take a hot bath, as hot as you can stand it, really, as hot as possible.  While you are in the bath, drink a hot beverage.  The best would be homemade bone broth, but it could be tea, or even just hot water. The goal is to induce an artificial fever. Do this right before bed. Stay in the tub as long as you can stand it, 20 minutes if you can make it. When you get out of the tub, stay as warm as possible, and go to bed immediately, covered in as many blankets as you can stand. Stay under the blankets until you fall asleep. If you can get your body heat high enough, you will kill the virus and feel great when you wake up the next day."
54251,Supercharge your immune system by eating only nutritious whole foods for 6-12 months before symptoms appear.
54252,You sarcastic fuck
54253,hey it works
54254,No it doesn't
54255,"But, it does."
54256,What's an arcasm? Do I want this?
54258,"The fuck's wrong with you? The most common virus that causes symptoms of a cold is known as rhinovirus. Secondly, if a cold is caused by your immune system removing toxins, then why does a cold spread through a community like one would expect an infectious disease to?

Fucking moron."
54260,I don't know maybe you got sick a bunch which made your immune system adapt and get better at fighting infections
54261,"Sweat it out. Not sure why, but it works for me every time. I put on multiple layers. Beanie, t-shirt, shorts, and thick socks. Then a thick hoodie and sweatpants. Then a heavy winter coat also with a hood. Crank up the heat. Then a heavy blanket. Wrap myself up like a burrito. And for good measure, like others have said, whiskey. Something about significantly raising my core temperature and having whiskey flowing through my veins makes my body a very inhospitable place for the virus. The next day, the worst I have is maybe a slightly runny nose."
54262,"This is how fevers work; they can make us better by making our body too hot for the invader to reproduce/live. However, DO be careful to not dehydrate or elevate your core temp over 101 or you could hurt yourself."
54264,"Drink dickloads of fluids, eat healthy food, get decent sleep and pray"
54265,How many dickloads should I drink?  I fear I may have over done it
54266,At least 3 dickloads... or 2 buttloads
54267,What if I can't swallow? Can I just gargle a dickload?
54268,Gargling warm salt water is actually a great way to kill germs in the throat.
54269,This is true. My aunt is a nurse and she taught me this
54270,You'd have to gargle 2 dickloads
54271,"But how big of a dick? I'm pretty sure not all Dick's were created equally. Are we talking black dickload or Asian dickload? I think if it were the latter, we would need to at least quadruple the amount. Or do you have to follow the dickload based off the size of your own dick? So the bigger the dick you have, the less quantity. But it will all equal out at the end since you have less of a quantity but a bigger serving size. 

And what about girls? Do they base it off the dick size of their dad or the last dick that they have had relations with? TBH I don't think girls should measure with dicks. Guys dicks sizes shouldn't be given out like that especially dads' to their daughters. Maybe they can use boob size. 

So guys can measure dickloads based on the size of their own dick while girls measure titloads based on the size of their hooters."
54272,Purely volume wise a titload would be at least 4 buttloads and about 7 dickloads based on an average white dick
54273,"I'm currently feeling under the weather myself, and this made me chuckle out loud. Thanks, stranger :)"
54274,You're welcome and I hope you return to full health where you won't have to drink dickloads of anything unless you want to :)
54275,http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/10367/A-Buttload-is-an-actual-unit-of-measurement
54276,If OMG facts said it then it must be true.
54277,What size/color dick load?
54278,Thor prevents 100% of my colds.
54279,"Yes ""praying"" is the key part! Pray all day and night and you will be cured. Hallelujah!!"
54280,"Get a shot of steroids. Politicians, Entertainers and the soon-to-be-married-the-next-day get by this way often enough."
54281,[Studies have shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496046) that taking zinc within the first 24 hours of symptoms will actually reduce the duration and severity of the common cold.
54282,"Zinc, administered with the once popular nasal gel, swabbed into the nasal passages, was the only accused culprit for losing the sense of smell. While zinc can be ingested as tablets, nasal gel, slow dissolve lozenges, or oral spray... nasal gel was used because the best absorption is via mucus membranes (nose and mouth) and you didn't have to worry about the taste.
I use Zicam zinc mouth spray and I take a strong Multi-vitamin during first symptoms of a cold and it seems to minimize symptoms quickly."
54283,"Adding... zinc totally helps, I use it frequently... Go to the pharmacy, get a bottle from the vitamin aisle, take 1 pill/day as early as possible, you prob won't need more than 2 days worth. It will not make you lose smell (from personal experience this has never been the case). But make sure you take that shit with food, or it will make you puke. No joke."
54284,Zinc is always my go to. I have never had bad colds while using it.
54286,That's for nasal sprays which are banned.
54287,"This is my routine when I get a cold.

1. Drink a large amount of orange juice.
2. Take a very hot shower.
3. Put on warm pants, socks, and a sweater.
4. Go to bed under a warm comforter or several blankets.

I always wake up feeling like a new man."
54288,"I eat a lot of raw habanero peppers, they're loaded with vitamin c and I've read that capsaicin has a lot of health benefits. Also i load up on vitamin d3.  I've heard oregano oil is supposed to act as an antiviral and my friend swears by it but i have never tried it.  

Warning: habaneros are not recommended for weak people"
54289,"Raw ginger grated , honey and hot water. Try to rest as much as possible . To be honest though if you can do it cut some raw ginger into thin slices and just eat it .. Munch it up and swallow it's tough at first but you get used to it . Google raw ginger for its benefits .. If the cold has already taken you will have to ride this one out but in future if you feel one coming in get the ginger down . I have kept many a cold away by doing this while lift sharing with people who have stinking colds .."
54291,"Will try the whisky, straight or mix? I'm guessing straight would help with the nose."
54292,"I make a hot totty. Half a mug of whiskey or brandy, juice from half a lemon, 3-5 cloves, spoon of honey and fill the rest of the mug with hot water. Drink it as fast as you can and go to bed. You'll sweat like never before and feel better the next day."
54293,Don't drink it so fast you vomit. Ask me how I know.
54294,Well....yea....don't do that. :D
54296,Cloves of what?
54297,Cloves as in... Cloves? The small black nail-shaped things.
54298,"Oh sorry, I have garlic clove mania and it was the only clove I wanted to be..."
54299,They're called whole cloves. You can get them in the spice isle.
54300,"reminds me of [snakejuice](http://themilkmanswife.blogspot.com/2009/02/homemade-couh-syrup.html) which is very, very effective!"
54301,hey man just did this n wow it works. thank you
54302,Never water down good whiskey!
54303,Ice brings out the flavours though.
54305,"Yes, cold whiskey tastes like antifreeze. Give it to us waaarm, and tingling."
54306,Do not drink when you are sick.
54307,Whisky is frontier medicine!
54308,Lie down on the couch!
54309,"Garlic in your butt. Legitimately a clove just up there. Then a lot of water. Loads of honey and vitamin c. And rest. And BAM 
You get well."
54310,"I got the clove up there but all the water is making it difficult to keep it in. 

Edit: I rolled some vitamin c pills in honey and worked those up in there too.  

I'll let you know how I feel tomorrow."
54311,"[Careful, you might get pooh](http://imgur.com/a8vz8nC)"
54312,"Well. Did the pis work? The garlic would
Have."
54313,"Obviously this is a joke, but garlic is sold in pill form as a nutritional supplement."

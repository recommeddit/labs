Or she would take a couple to wherever she wanted them but then get tired so she would bring the next one to me and make me follow her and take her babies wherever she wanted them so she didn't have to keep going back and forth carrying all the babies.

She immediately went into labour."
19231,"Like humans, cats need a hand to squeeze also."
19232,"Ferrets are very communal. She perceives her human as another ferret in the ‘group’. It’s sweet that they are so well bonded. She might be the lone ferret in the house, because she would likely act like this with another ferret. ‘LOOK AT MY BABIES!!”

19382,"Airforceproud95. I don't understand half of the flying terminology, but it's hilarious all the same."
19383,It's always a guess when the hot air balloon or air force one appears
19384,Everyone gangsta till the airplane goes space shuttle Atlantis mode
19385,Space shuttle status: confirmed.
19386,"You've certainly buttered my bread there, sauce-boss."
19387,"""We just got side swiped by a hot air balloon doing Mach 1""

Though my personal favorite is when he doing ATC and belts out 45 sec of flawless jargon in one breath and caps it with a ""full read back required"""
19388,"If you want something to brag about, afp95 follows everyone back on twitter, so I guess that's cool"
19390,"Nobody finds Tom Scott. Tom Scott finds you with randomly suggested, but moderately intriguing video titles when you said one more video 3 hours ago and now it's 4am..."
19391,Saw a randomly suggested bbc4 game show today and 5 min in I see a pony tailed Tom Scott...
19392,Only Connect is amazing.
19393,"He's been on YouTube since 2006. He's pretty much one of the original YouTubers and yet for the past 14 years, his content has been so consistently good, even when he made the shift towards more educational videos.

His stuff with the Technical Difficulties (Reverse Trivia, Citation Needed and Two Of These People Are Lying) is fantastic. If you like British panel shows like QI or Would I Lie To You, I can't recommend them enough. It's entertaining as hell."
19394,"Tom Scott is the YouTube version of clicking the ""random article"" button on Wikipedia"
19395,two drums and a cymbal fall off a cliff
19396,Ask A Mortician. Really anything by Caitlin Doughty IMO.
19397,I found her Titanic and Edmund Fitzgerald videos fantastic.
19398,She's amazing with a deadly sense of humour!
19399,hello fellow deathlings

19401,"Best channel on Youtube, only bad point is he uploads somewhat infrequently but it's always worth the wait."
19402,"Bill wurtz


Edit: 🎶thanks for checking in I’m still a piece of garbage 🎵"
19403,"He quit though

Edit: ok I guess he did not quit"
19404,It’s sad. I’m sad. I miss you.
19405,🎵 *How did this happen?* 🎵
19406,A long time ago
19407,Actually never
19408,Also now
19409,Nothing is nowhere
19410,When?
19411,Never
19412,"Isn't he still working on something big? Try asking on his website. Edit: i just checked, he's still answering questions."
19413,"Didn’t quit. From my information, he learning a new animation style, and learning animations doesn’t happen overnight."
19414,Bon Appetit! Especially their Gourmet Makes series.
19415,I love the big happy fella that does all the fermentations.
19416,This is the best and most wholesome description of Brad Leone
19417,You mean the human golden retriever?
19418,"The video editing for It's Alive is incredibly entertaining, too."
19419,Ayyayyhayyy Vinnie wouldmalookiehere look at :D us bud we made it!
19420,I love Brad but the editing really does it for me. Hunzie needs more appreciation.

19422,"I'm assuming this means:

I would die for Claire from the B A test kitchen"
19423,"How is nobody talking about Chris Morocco!?

I love watching him try to reconstruct food after just a brief, blindfolded inspection. The way he uses his senses and categorises everything fascinates me, I love his quirks.

Overall they captured lightning in a bottle with the lineup they have there - every one of them is a likable, kooky, larger than life character! It's like a sitcom cast, but they're real chefs."
19424,Morocco is my favorite right behind Claire. I can never get enough of him! He’s so damn sassy and I love him to bits.
19425,BA is an institution at this point.
19426,The Youtube comment sections are always pretty cultish. Those chefs are rockstars to their fans.
19427,"I love only two men. One is my boyfriend, and the other is Brad Leone."
19429,CallMeKevin and RTGame
19430,"Wow this was cool to come across, thanks! Made my morning :)"
19431,"kevin, if i could only watch one person on youtube, it would be you. :)"
19432,"I love RTGame; helped me get through some dark, lonely times. He’s such a great guy who’s also absolutely hilarious!"
19433,"GreyStillPlays has the same energy as both of them, if you don't watch his videos do it. He's great."
19434,Country roooooaaaaadddd
19435,"I love that Irish fecker and his weird vampire, wizard mass-kidnapping Sim."
19436,Dont forget drug dealing mermaid
19437,Dead Meat. Even if you’re not a horror movie fan. They’re funny and solid reviews so I get to be informed and not have to sit through a 90 minute movie.
19438,"That Final Destination 5 kill count was the greatest thing.

""Click here to see the uncensored version!"" *click* ""Hey, ya sick fucks!"""
19439,I read that with his voice
19440,"Aw so many nice comments here. Thanks so much, everyone - really made my day!!"
19441,"And conversly, dead meat has made me a way bigger horror fan than when I first started and has turned me on to some great movies! Watching Sinister was the highlight of my week and I would've had no desire to if notnfor the killcount!"
19442,I saw this post and the first channel I thought of was Dead Meat and then low and behold it was the top comment too.
19443,"Agreed! I laugh every time James says ""freaky!"" in his unique style haha."
19444,"""Dino-SORE"""
19445,"Ho boy!

The kill counts will save you countless hours of watching horror movies that you otherwise wouldn't want to see. Those are my personal faves"
19446,"Obligatory mobile formating.

*For the really good quality channels that uploads once every century:*

**Nerd City**- Just really good at making videos

**Michael Reeves** - Funny robot shenanigans that takes toll on a 4'3"" filipino a few months at a time. Would recommend.

**LEMMiNO** - Documetary style content, very nice.

**Crowbcat** - For exposing the shitty video game company practices.

**Nexpo** - Internet mysteries and horror.

**Sam O’ Nella Academy** - History with a twist.

**Vsauce** - Interesting science stuff, stands tall as having the only good yt red show in existence.

**Bill Wurtz** - Commentary/music with interesting visuals. (rip?)

Quality is always > Quantity imo"
19447,"Just wanted to point out that Bill Wurtz is still alive in kicking. He’s currently learning new computer graphics stuff and is working on new songs. If you go to his website he is answering questions every day, honestly pretty funny."
19449,"Mark Rober,
Kurzegast- in a nutshell(dk if i spelt that right),
 etc


 Edit: kurzgesagt*


There are alot more. Cant remember them atm."
19450,"The Infographics Show is really terrible. Their ""facts"" are usually wrong. They have decent artwork, but make sure you double check EVERYTHING you see on there, because they are wrong a lot of the time. They've had to pull videos before because people who actually knew something about it called them out. Check out the video of the actual fighter jet pilot critiquing the video they did on fighter pilots........."
19451,The Virgin Infographics Show vs. The Chad Kurzgesagt
19452,"[Etho](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKDEp9si4RmHFWJW1vYsMA) if you're into chill Minecraft videos

19453,"Etho is the ONE youtuber I will watch every video from, as soon as I can. It's been so many years and I don't get tired of his videos. I love how fast paced his series are in terms of progress each episode, and he's always so creative with redstone."
19454,yeah man he puts a lot of time off camera in his work. I love it.
19455,"Ah yes, found Etho!!!"
19456,The entire Hermitcraft sever are really cool
19457,Keralis is probably one I would single out (unless you want to learn everyone’s name) as a really good watch for being an incredibly talented builder and very funny with a lot of subtle jokes.
19458,Bless Gun Jesus!
19459,Seconding Internet Comment Etiquette
19460,LEMMiNo is a personal favorite of mine.
19461,"I remember when his name was ""Toptenmemes"""
19462,Ye boi. He made a really good decision with changing his channel name and direction.
19463,Just found this channel randomly when his D.B. Cooper video popped into my recommendations.
19464,"I stumbled on him the other day and binged most of the videos


The [Dyatlov Pass one](https://youtu.be/Y8RigxxiilI) was my personal favourite just because it's so bizarre the way they were found and I'd never heard the story before"
19465,Check out Bedtime Stories. They focus on supernatural happenings and events. Really good stuff!
19466,I found his video on that one S everyone use to draw.
19467,Casually explained
19468,"His ""Is she into you"" video is hilarious and i still quote it to this day.

""So say she takes you upstairs, strips naked and starts riding on top of you having sex.

Is she into you?

Yeah, kinda hard to tell here, can't really say. Maybe she's Canadian and she's just being nice."""

19473,"if you are financially able, the director's commentary is so good"
19474,I love the bizarre borders videos.
19475,"If you like that, then you also might like the Map Men. I think it’s on Jay Foreman’s YouTube channel"
19477,"Yep. I binged watched all of TierZoo's videos. Then, in biology class when we were learning about evolution, I couldn't stop thinking about the concept of organisms just spending their evolution points."
19478,"When I saw his videos first time, I was so intrigued that I binge watched practically all of his videos"
19479,OverSimplified
19480,Just watched their ww2 oversimplified again for the third time last night. I love that one it’s funny.

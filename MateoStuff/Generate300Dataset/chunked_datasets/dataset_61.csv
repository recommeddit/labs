Just a few good ones to be listed above..."
19500,Veritasium is pretty interesting.
19501,Life of Boris
19502,VADIM BLYAT!
19503,honestly boris's cooking videos hold up very well and I use his recipes all the time
19504,"Geography Now: good videos on countries going from A-Z with comedy and good info. 

NFKRZ: A Russian talking about topics inside Russia and some good fun content (speaks english and subtitles Russian dialogue into English)

Indigo Traveler: New Zealander single user travel vlog. Goes to amazing off the beat places.

Paolo From Tokyo: my favorite foreigner living in Japan channel

RTGame: the only gaming channel I watch because its not taken seriously

Weird History: title says it all

Every Frame A Painting: best film thesis channel on youtube (but it no longer produces content but always rewatchable)"
19505,"Townsend's. A historical reenactor with a cooking show where he makes 17th century America dishes in authentic (enough) environments. He also does a lot of videos about the quality of life and how they used various tools. Hes just super passionate about what he does, it's very endearing."
19506,"Defunctland.

Does detailed and super interesting videos on defunct theme park attractions, as well as former TV shows. They just did an episode on Between the Lions."
19507,First we feast (Hot ones)
19508,"The Gordon Ramsay Hot Ones had me in stitches, I couldn't breathe from how hard I was laughing"
19509,The show with hot questions and even hotter wings (pointing finger up).
19510,ScotttheWoz - Is a humours video game collected and is worth a watch
19511,"I knew I'd find this if I kept scrolling. He knows the perfect balance between humor and information, and his jokes never feel forced either!"
19512,"Gus Johnson and Eddy Burback's channels are both amazing, and their podcast is hilarious"
19513,Boys support boys 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
19514,Brandon Rogers. He's sketches are like early-youtube videos but with an hd camera.
19515,"Cody Ko. I could binge watch his series with Noel Miller (That's Cringe) all day. Also, Danny Gonzalez and Drew Gooden are pretty dope too"
19516,"the that's cringe series is SO funny. literally every single one had me cackling

goddamn you, DRE DREXLER!!!!!"
19517,Kurtis Conner as well is great! Him and those four are the ones I watch pretty often
19518,Ask a Mortician- Caitlin Doughty is a US based mortician all about breaking  taboos and getting us all talking about death. Wonderfully macabre without really being too morbid. She's written a couple of books since and I'm an absolute fan girl.
19519,"[Legal Eagle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpa-Zb0ZcQjTCPP1Dx_1M8Q) covers topical news from a legal perspective, in laymans language and also covers movies and and tv shows and how they perform from a legal realism standpoint, informative and debunks a lot of the more annoying 'I am not a lawyer but...' hot takes you see online."
19520,He also roasts r/legaladvice
19521,Sam O'nella Academy
19522,"Have a seat with Chris Hansen

Edit: I also recommend Sam O’Nella Academy"

19526,I love RedLetterMedia. Must watch if you like movies
19527,"The best thing about them is they have something for everyone. If you want to watch shit movies get ripped apart, they have that (Best of the Worst). If you want to watch in-depth reviews of some of your favourites, they have that (re;View). If you just want contemporary reviews to find out if a movie is worth spending your money on, they have that too (Half in the Bag).

And... if you want to watch a 116 year-old serial killer with an addiction to pizza rolls bitch about Star Wars, you have that too (Mr. Plinkett)."
19528,"If you want to watch Mike force his friends to talk about Star Trek, watch the Picard reviews."
19529,"Tom Scott, Lindsay Ellis"
19530,Second Lindsay Ellis. She rocks! Love her video essays on story telling. Love the deeper dives into why movies were made the way they were due to culture. Wish she was able to do more.

19772,"Here are some of my personal faves, I can't pick just one of these. If you find the selection a bit random, it's because i watch a mishmash of pretty much everything. Anyways:

 

**POLYBIUS - The Video Game That Doesn't Exist** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_7X6Yeydgyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7X6Yeydgyg)

One hour documentary about the urban legend of Polybius, the quality is stunning and the all of the videos on this channel are really good and I highly recomend them.

**TempleOS | Down the Rabbit Hole** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCgoxQCf5Jg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCgoxQCf5Jg)

A video about the story of Temple OS and it's schizophrenic creator Terry A. Davis. The rest of Frederik Knudsen's videos are pretty good too, mostly talking about strange things, events and such; the Time Cube, the Collyer Brothers, Chris-chan, etc. are some of the stuff he's covered.

**The Unknowns: Mystifying UFO Cases** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7T1v\_VHpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7T1v_VHpE)

The video delves into the expansive and complicated history of American UFO research. More precisely, the government sanctioned undertaking known as Project Blue Book, exploring a few of these unknowns in order to understand what makes them so mystifying. I'm repeating myself, but guess what: the rest of Lemmino's videos are great too.

**history of the entire world, i guess** \- [https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs](https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs) 

The even better sequel to the instant classic ""history of japan"".

**The Youtube Geographic series** \- [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjXwcOEO8rkR0XeFTCoeaMk74V-49PyAt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjXwcOEO8rkR0XeFTCoeaMk74V-49PyAt)

Yeah, yeah, i know it's not one video, but all of them are very good videos. They are about certain events in Youtube's history, told in a entertaining way.

**Athletic Theme (PAL Version) - Super Mario World** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEcOzjg7vBU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEcOzjg7vBU)

Don't be fooled by the name. It's not actually real, but a pretty epic remix. I warn you, it's impossible to unhear. It's been 2 years and i'm still always disappointed when i hear the original because i expect this tbh :/

**The Penguins of Madagascar Obtain the N Word Pass** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjt-xRkjFaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjt-xRkjFaY)

Very HQ meme.

**MINE DIAMONDS | miNECRAFT PARODY OF TAKE ON ME** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgha9S39Y6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgha9S39Y6M)

I will never forget this video.

**YouTube Rewind 2018 but it's actually good** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By\_Cn5ixYLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By_Cn5ixYLg)

19779,"Came here to say this, very happy someone beat me to it.

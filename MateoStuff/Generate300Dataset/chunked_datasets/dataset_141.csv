45204,My cat was free so that
45205,Instant Pot & slow cooker
45206,Zelda Breath of the Wild
45207,"I went to a training thing this summer and didn't realize the rooms they set us up in didn't have any linens, so I went to a local store and bought a generic fleece blanket for like $15.  Holy shit not only is it huge, but it is warm as fuck, and now I still use it back home as my main sleeping blanket."
45208,"So many things I own are less than that. My dog was $25. The Bible my husband got right before he moved was $25. Our wedding rings were $35 total. The kit I use to keep my shit together was $35 total, including pens and a notebook and post its and crap. My cane, that allows me to have freedom still, was $30. 

The best parts of my life, my fondest memories, are either $20-40 or $500-1k. There's no in between really."
45209,"An Amazon Echo Dot. I didn't own a speaker, so that alone made it worth it"
45210,"If you cook, put one in your kitchen. Music, timers, reminders... the awesomeness never ends."
45211,"My first running shoes, Nike Vomero 11. Totally life changing, because I used to get toe cramps all the time and now I don't."
45212,"I bought a pair of vomero 8's and have reupped with the new model every year even if I don't need a new pair. Seriously the best shit ever, say what you want about Nike but they make fucking great shoes. This year's Vomero is the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever worn."
45213,I love my Zojirushi travel mug. I love how it keeps coffee or tea warm throughout the day. I also like how it is less bulky that my previous travel mug.
45214,"My sewing maching, I got it used."
45215,"My wireless bluetooth headphones.

I'm blind in one eye and had surgery in the other eye last year, which didn't go quite as planned and left me almost blind (could only see dark/light and some motion) for a two month period. Bought the headphones the day before. They effortlessly connect to my phone and have buttons for volume, fast forward/rewind and play/pause.

I listened to 8 or more audiobooks during that time. Having something to occupy my mind and that I couls operate kept me sane. Best money I ever spent.

I see great now with my good eye, but still carry rhe headphones everywhere."
45305,Some elaboration would be much apreciated.
45306,Switch. Nintendo does a really good job of appealing to all age groups. Most of their games are kid friendly but still very fun for adults
45307,"Thanks, do the games run well, i read that the PS4 just like i with the PS3 could experience some FPS drops here and there, how is this on the switch?"
45308,"alot of games are exclusive to the switch so those will run great. other games im not 100% sure, but I've never heard/seen any complaints"
45309,"nintendo has always been the way to go, when kid parent interaction is a thing...looking back on fond zelda memories with your kid is a nice thing to do...also don´t worry about the weakness factor, nintendo always had weak consoles, but good programmers"
45310,"Thanks. Does the Switch also have decent mobile time, when hand helt?   
Been expecting that Nintendo was the go to, but the only experience i had was the DS back in the day and that was a downer :P"
45311,"i dont know, i don't own a switch, planning on tho"
45312,"Meh the switch sucks. Feels like aims too much over their old games (which are child friendly too much) while the rest looks like crap, also not a fan of the controls AT ALL"
45313,"Just curious, what is it with the controlls you don't like? Is it the layout or something else?"
45314,"They're too small, lack grip due their flat finish isn't ergonomic like xbox or ps4 and is gimmicky, uses motion gyroscope to aim in certain games since like I've said before the joysticks are REALLY small. Also as a handheld console is TOO big (ironic i know) but as a house plugged console is weak"
45315,"Well, either one would be suggested by me over the Xbox which features more mature oriented games.

The PS4 is amazing for it's catalog of exclusives and a general family oriented catalog as well.

However, I think the switch is the way to go. Nintendo is extremely good about being family friendly and with their access to 3rd party titles you'll get a plethora of adult games as well."
45316,"Thanks.  What do you mean with the 3rd party titles?   


Seems Xbox is out then, as it really has to be kid friendly.   


Does nintendo have something like Sony where you sign in online?"
45317,"3rd party titles refers to games made by companies that are not Nintendo. With the Wii-U they had almost no 3rd party titles so there were very few games at all on the console. With the switch, they are bringing in far more games from other companies."
45318,probably the Xbox if for both. if mostly for the kid get a switch
45319,Would be mostly for the kid for sure.
45321,Also my kid really liked SNES Mini although I bought it for myself
45322,"You can use a PC as a console, just plug in a Xbox one or PS4 controller and connect it to your tv"
45323,"Well, the thing is, she often wants to play when we are on our PC.  She now plays on the tablet, but mobile games are riddled with ads and cashgrabs, so i rather get her some proper gamedevice so she can play and explore in a more ""safe"" area without ads and aluring cash shops."
45324,"Switch definitely is the best in terms of family-friendly exclusives, plus it can be a handheld as well"
45325,"Thanks.  You you know how long the battery lasts when gaming hand helt?  Having only a laptop as a reference, that lasted hardly an hour :P"
45326,"That depends what you're playing, it's supposed to be at least 2,5 hours and up to 6"
45327,"Ok, that is not too bad, and i gues it would have the option to charge in the car as well."
45328,"Yeah, it's about 2.5 hours when playing the legend of Zelda breath of the wild in handheld."
45329,You can't go wrong with any console. Tbh I'd probably get your kid a switch. An Xbox would be my second option since game pass is an amazing way to try a lot of family friendly coop games and not break the bank.
45330,"Xbox one for sure. Switch is pathetically weak (and i don't care about graphics but sheesh looks awful aside mario and zelda) and lacks games. Ps4 is the most powerful in the basic form but feels like aims towards adults more with their cinematic games 

Xbox is the most balanced, good games, excellent price and decent performance"
45331,"Oh, Switch has not many games?  That wouldn't be a very good thing.  And well it would surely be nice if the games do not look very bad. Even though it is mainly for my kid, graphics do matter to a degree."
45332,"I mean it has lots of those ""party games"" than nobody cares, the third party games (the multiplatforms that are available in all consoles) like doom, wwe, nba, fifa, are the worst of all the versions available due the weak hardware and run mostly at HD resolution or even lower which is unacceptable in 2018"
45333,"Mhm well those games are not really in the scope. Wil be more along the lines of pokemon, mariocart and other kiddie games"
45334,"Well there's Crash Bandicoot, yooka laley, rayman and sonic games on xbox one as well, and like I said before look prettier on xbox than Nintendo"
45381,"Own a PC, switch and PS5. Will get a game on pc if its available otherwise get it on the system its exclusive to. No need for a xbox.

PS games coming to pc is fine, they normally get ported over a couple of years after release or when its sequel is about to release. I'll still end up getting it on PS first."
45382,"Yeah, this is pretty much me right now. 

In regards to PlayStation, they have too many amazing games I don't want to miss out on. I'm happy to play it on PS5 first, and then if the game is good enough, I'll buy it again on PC like I did with Horizon Zero Dawn. I'd rather not have to wait a couple years for some of these games, but that's just me. 

As for the Switch, obviously I'm there for their exclusives, but there are some games I may get on Switch instead or double up on both PC and the Switch like Hades or Enter the Gengeon. Being able to play portably is just too convenient. I'd love to get a PC handheld like the Switch."
45383,"It's the same for me and I'll get the PC version of timed exclusive console games, if the game really interested me to play more (MHW, RDR2, ...) and the port isn't a total disaster (unlike launch Horizon Zero Dawn)."
45384,tbh anyone who owns a remotely decent PC has no reason to get an Xbox. Unlike with Playstation and switch.
45385,"I can live without PS games but the switch experience is hard to let go of once you get used to it

Now if they could drop prices of older titles a bit that would be great"
45386,"Normally, if the port is good, I'll get a multi-platform title on PC. However with the GPU market as it is, I'm buying most games on PS5, because my GTX 970 is wimpy in comparison and, I can't get a new one because of the shortages.

Timed releases are dependent on length of exclusivity and console performance. For instance, I'm not getting MH Rise on Switch because it runs like shit with poor resolution. I'll wait for a PC release."
45387,"This describes my approach as well. I still have an Xbox one s tho, thanks for not supporting Dolby vision Sony..."
45388,"I have a PS4 I haven't used in months, but I was going to get a PS5 soon after it came out.  Before I could, my 6/7 year old PC shat itself so a replacement for that became a priority.  I ended up getting a decent PC, love it, and am unlikely to get a PS5 anytime soon, if at all(having owned Playstations 1-4 previously). I will at some stage sell my PS4 (and Vita) and be console-less for the first time in years.  But  I'm more than OK with that."
45389,"Like most here, PC is by far my main platform. I do have a PS4 and a Switch as well.

In the last 12 months I have bought 1 PS4 game and 1 Switch game. I will likely be getting Mario Golf as well, but that will be all the console games.

Where as my PC I have bought 10+ games easily in 2021. 

As for Resident Evil, I just finished it on PC. Ultrawide, custom FOV, and much cheaper than buying on console."
45390,"I used to be a console only player and strongly prefer controller since kb/m was alien to me. Few years after getting into pc gaming I just appreciate how fluid and unrestricted my movement are compared to controller.

 So for now all gaming preferred on pc, I just keep a Playstation and a nintendo switch purely for their respective exclusives."
45391,I honestly tend to feel the opposite by virtue of only able to move in 8 directions vs the whole sweet 360 range.
45392,"I have a PC, PS5 and a Switch. I mainly game on PC and sometimes PS5. The Switch I mainly got to play with my girl and the PS5 for exclusives and as a media device for  my LG CX OLED.

If a game is hinted or announced for PC I will wait for that version. I rather play everything on PC but if a game interest me enough and is 60fps on console I'll play it.


I will always opt for PC given the choice though. Why? Well I can afford good hardware and the experience on PC(144hz+,KBM,custom settings,mods,etc) is just far far superior.

 Also how do I feel about PS exclusives coming to PC? Not enough of them and not nearly soon enough. Let's get all of them on PC so they can shine at their maximum potential."
45393,"I have a pc, series x, ps5 and switch… i use them all equally. Pc i usually exclusively play FPS games, and exclusives. Ps5 its exclusives and all the ps4 games i own, Xbox i like playing forza and gears on the tv with a controller and not to mention all the 360 and Xbox games I own! And switch is really for smash and Mario kart right now. I dont mind sony releasing their games on pc it seems like they are releasing old games ive already beaten on pc so its not as if I’m feeling like I made a bad purchase."
45394,"I'm at Pc and switch right now for this generation.

Last generation it was pc,ps4 and the 3ds back when the ps4 still had exclusive games,and I was able to softmod both consoles,so no time bomb for me."
45395,"Mostly PC. But if there are local coop games, I'll play them on playstation."
45396,"Own a PC and PS4, Xbox, Switch and PSVita. They all have their uses depending on type of game, but my PC gets the most playtime. Maybe part of it is because my PC is powerful enough to crush most games and on top of that the ability to use my PS4 or Xbox controller. Playing couch co-op games like Overcooked 2 with the gf, using both the Xbox and Ps4 controller at the same time couldn't be easier. Whilst personally being into heavy strategy games like Anno 1800 where mouse + keyboard gaming is a must. I may get a Ps5 when there's enough stock and prices even out, or when the inevitable re-design comes. In the end, if I can enjoy Playstation games on my PC I almost always prefer to play on PC (also I'm not a trophy hunter)."
45397,"PC is my main platfrom. I barely touch console(ps4) except when I want to play coop.

On Pc mods, unofficial patches, customisable graphics are the reason I prefer it. Not to mention free online service."
45398,I've found myself tending towards console because of how useful the suspend functionality is.
45399,"Ps5, series x, switch, pc. 

Ps5 in bedroom for action adventure games. Nier, immortals, etc. Also fighting games and exclusives. 

Series x for back compat and exclusives. 

Switch for exclusives. Haven't touched since Zelda. It's actually packed up in my garage. 

Pc for most games for multiple reasons. 

-Cheaper games

-No online fee
(Anthem unusable on series x without gold. Plays just fine on pc) 

-Any game with precision aiming feels much better on pc. Shooters. 

-Emulation. Currently have a Wii set up on my PC. Playing punch out and Silent hill on the Wii in HD. 

-Mods. 
Even slight tweaks make all the difference. Like more gore, faster walking speed, etc. 

-Multitasking

-Older games

-rts/strategy games."
45400,this is /r/pcgaming. the results are goona be biased
45401,"Well I can't speak for myself because I don't own any current consoles (although I grew up with them from the SNES and Genesis and had them up to the PS3 and 360 along with PC gaming...stopped console gaming altogether in 2013 before the PS4 came out), but from what I've seen with my friends and family who has both, they have different use cases. Some of them have a shitty pre-built or a Macbook Pro and use that for their PC needs and use a console for their gaming needs. Others who have a capable gaming PC and use it for everything and use a console for exclusives. 

As far as those people who have a capable PC and have a PS console, they were more than willing to pick up HZD again on PC for the simple fact that it can run at 60fps. At least that's what they told me when I asked them why they doubled dipped. They said the same thing about RDR2."
45402,I prefer console over PC because I prefer controllers and couch gaming on a 60” 4k screen. My PC can only do 1440 at higher refresh and struggle to run new titles at 4k. So i mainly use my PS4 pro. I do have an extensive steam library and enjoy getting g games at a deep discount whenever they run sales. So my playing is maybe 60/40 console to PC.
45403,Smh. Why do you people speak such nonsense all the time. You can pc game on a couch with a controller. You don't need to have a big tower. Small mini itx cases are a thing.
45404,"PC, PS4 Slim and Switch.

PC is a good 99% for me. I can play on either my monitors or my LG C9 OLED. I choose PC because I can play using whatever controls I want, alter FOV and co, get both better visuals and framerate. Mods if I want and if there's any worth installing.

Last two games I played on PS4 were Final Fantasy VII Remake and The Last of Us Part 2. I'm excited to see more games come to PC. I ordered Days Gone's Steam key on GMG already, actually.

Exclusivity sucks, and I dislike it even more when VR gets exclusivity like how RE7 is a PSVR exclusive or Resident Evil 4 is only on Oculus Quest 2 (which I do also own though)"
45405,"PC for fps games and PS for social stuff like fifa, where friends are visiting"
45406,"The one which offers highest graphics and frame rate first, that's my gaming desktop.

However some games are forever exclusives, so PS4 and Switch for those.

I'll usually wait a few years before playing an exclusive game on the chance that it gets ported. Plus by then a lot of patches and quality of life improvements should have happened."
45407,"I play most games online with friends on pc. I play as many turn based games as I can on the switch including xcom and battle brothers which I also own on PC. Other than that I only use the switch to feel bad about myself by playing smash bros with my younger brother. I also have a ps4 which I’ve only played a few singleplayer games, but i feel like those few games have made it worth the purchase price. (Rdr2, ghost of tsushima, god of war, spiderman)"
45408,"Now I don't have a consola, so PC is the answer and I believe is the best choice. I don't remember a XBOX game that I can't play on PC. Of course there're some PS exclusives games like God of War series, and the new spiderman game. Some old PS games are coming to PC"
45409,"Own a pc, switch and ps4. Exclusives are on their respective systems obviously. Platformers and games that are better handheld or better played in short bursts are on switch. Rest goes on to pc.

Maybe I'd have preferred ps4 more if I had a giant tv with a couch setup or something and my pc wasn't hooked up to it. But all my devices are connected to the same 27 inch monitor so, pc and console experience is more or less the same to me. Therefore, playing/owning the games on a platform that allows higher fidelity is a no-brainer."
45410,My ps4 is now dinner and netflix machine
45411,"Pc is for anything first person, strategy, and sim type games. Switch is for Nintendo exclusive, and indies that I will play more in short sessions. PS4/5 is for exclusives, and smaller Japanese games that tend to get pretty shoddy ports years later."
45412,"Pc, PS4 and switch.

Pc is primary, I’d buy 99% of games on there.


PS4 is a glorified blu ray player tbh. Switch would get some use if the game prices weren’t rip offs. I picked up a visual novel on steam for £7 and it’s on switch for £35 or something nonsensical like that. Why waste money? 


I get more use out of my fat ps3 due to ps1 and 2 games being playable on there. At the moment I’m playing suikoden 2 for example, but I can load up breath of fire 3 or various other titles with ease. There’s not many ps3-4 titles that I can’t get on pc tho. 


I’d buy more on the ps3 if they unlocked the regions so we could be us exclusive ps1/2 era titles back when companies thought English was exclusive to the USA and Europe wasn’t a market. 😂🤦‍♂️ cos there’s so many games we missed out on in Europe :("
45413,"Both for gaming. I was using a PS4 for exclusives and shooters that are filled with cheating on pc, ie BFV. Now that Sony is putting exclusives on Steam, Im in no hurry for a PS5. I might bite if a Twisted Metal of Socom reboot get announced."
45414,"I went from owning all systems last gen to only PC and Switch this gen

There's nothing non-exclusive that's worth playing on console anymore, there used to be broken PC ports, or fighting games that were DOA on PC, but that's just not the case anymore. The Switch's portability doesn't justify the higher prices and worse visuals and performance, especially since modern phones can run things like Minecraft or Stardew Valley.

Xbox has everything ported over to PC and PS looks like it's going that way too, so there's no reason to buy them at all, hopefully Nintendo follows eventually."
45415,I have my gaming rig and an Xbox Series S that replaced my ps4 when it recently died. I play everything on PC for the most part. The Xbox has game pass and is for sports games and older 360 games like Army of Two.
45416,"I have a ps4, switch, and PC. Tend to use the former 2 more for gaming since I work a lot on my PC already and don't have too much time for gaming, so I usually rather want to hop in a sofa and boot up my game rather then having to potentially deal with compatibility problems, tweaking settings to my hardware etc....  


I only play exclusives and games that really benefit from modding (like Bethesda games, outside Skyrim since I love that on switch), latest RE games don't really have any game changing mods and are optimized enough that they play great on console vs my PC imo, so I'll be getting these on ps4/5."
45417,"I just started to write blogs, and recently, I have written a blog on [Top Five Best Gaming Consoles 2021](https://ifixscreens.com/top-five-best-gaming-consoles-2021/), so if you want to know more, feel free to read and plz review it."
45418,"I only use PS5 for exclusives, else I play on my Series X. So the answer for me is Series X, much prefer the Microsoft ecosystem and the features they have. Oh, and Game Pass Ultimate (also includes EA games). Also, with Game Pass, I get a minimum 10% discount on other games I purchase - so there's that too, I mean why pay more on the PS5 when I get it cheaper on Xbox?

For PC, I use that to play strategy games like Age of Empires, Command & Conquer series, etc."
45419,"I buy games for my pc when they’re multiplayer or will are really pushing the limits visually, or I want to stream it. I get games for ps5 when i want to play on my couch or co op with my wife or if it’s exclusive. I double dip on a lot of indies on my switch as well"
45420,"My honest recommendation is to go for the Switch since it's the most relaxed of the consoles. You can undock it and play it on the couch and has a lot of great exclusives. Sure, it can't match the others in specs but you can play a bunch of indies, party games or Nintendo exclusives in it."
45421,Wait a while. The ps5 and Xbox Scarlet are on the way
45422,Xbox one x
45423,Ps4 because if you want to upgrade to the ps5 it has been confirmed to be backwards compatible
45424,"ps5 coming next year, just saying"
45425,"Depends on the kind of games you wanna play. Also don't forget the next gen should start releasing in a year, so it may be better to wait for that and just find yourself a couple of titles on pc to wait.

There's also the switch. Great console, great librairy( with strong titles still releasing or to be released) and it's not gonna be killed till at least 2021."
45426,Xbox all the way. I switched to ps4 when I grew up on the OG xbox and the 360. Now I regret my decisions. I mostly play PC now while my ps4 just collects dust.
45427,What about the Xbox has kept you in that family?
45428,"Definitley Halo, and the xbox controller. Theyre very nostalgic to me."
45429,"Do you have a game bar or gaming cafe where you can try them out?
I'd do that before investing.

Since you have a PC already you can play Xbox games via win 10 and Xbox anywhere. Just get a controller and an HDMI cable to connect to your TV. That controller also will have support built in to Steam.

Sony's releasing PS5 soon so I'd read up on that before buying into PS4.

That leaves the Switch, which has a LOT of fun games. 

Just some food for thought.
GL"
45430,"Well if you are choosing between the ps4 or the xbox one, I'd say go with the PS4 because Exclusive games > everything else, at least in my humble opinion."
45431,"As per rumours going around that gta 6 will be exclusive next generation game, i suggest u buy cheaper option to play for one year. 

And next year when both next gen consoles are released pick any one."
45432,Honestly I’d just stick to pc or either just wait for ps5/Xbox Scorpio next Holliday season.
45433,Playstation has the player pool by a long shot. If multiplayer is on your list go Playstation.
45434,"I know this isnt the question, but I feel its something to consider. you could get a steam link and a bluetooth controller and PC game from the couch. Or just put your PC by your TV. If all of your friends are on PC I'd just stay there... use the money you saved to buy some new games. 

Unless there is a very specific list of console exclusives you want to play. Then just get the console with the most exclusives."
45435,I mean Last of Us is what’s really making this decision hard for me. I loved the first and I love what PS4 does with its exclusives it’s really what makes it special. I also am more attracted to its UI than that of the Xbox. Yet Xbox is the more powerful console and I do already own games for it I can play on PC. I feel like I just answered this for myself but I’m literally so indecisive
45436,Microsoft is planning to release most of its major exclusives on PC anyway. Just buy the PS4 if you absolutely have to have a console. Or just borrow one from a friend. That's what I did when I wanted to play the last of us.
45437,"If you can hold off, next gen consoles are coming holiday 2020. I've always had Xbox but I think I'm gonna be picking up the PS5."
45438,"PS4. Go back and play some of the other exclusives you may have missed like horizon zero dawn and god of war. They’re very much worth checking out. And as for the Xbox exclusives, just get the Xbox game pass on pc. It’s only $1 right now and $5 per month after that to get Xbox games at launch on pc. Also great for other non-exclusives like the outer worlds"
45439,Go with your gut.  Ps4 pro
45440,"Wait for the ps5 mate, I'm also on pc but I'll probably buy a ps5 when they come out too"
45441,PS4 pro since pc has Xbox exclusive
45442,"Nintendo GameCube. It's small, portable has a screen, great library of games no online connection required, downloads or updates and has a handle.

Best console ever."
45443,Nintendo switch lite. Chill games are nintendo games
45444,Joycon Drift. Also going from PC to that would be brutal.
45445,"I'm a pc gamer and didn't touch my pc for like 2 months after getting my switch and you can always buy other controlers so you don't break your joycons. I have a 8bitdo sn30 pro cabled (30 canadian bucks) as my main controller and I use the Hori charging station or I use a male usb-c to female usb-a adaptor ( cost me 4 bucks ) to enjoy all my games.

The only time I ever use the joycons it's when I need the motion control aspect, like for botw when you get the motion control shrines."
45446,I like PS4 over Xbox because the controller is easier for me to hold.
45447,I dont want to play games at 30 fps or low resolutions/settings. There are some games on console that run fairly well but id rather not play a game like fallout 4 at 30 fps with drops well into the low 20's.
45448,"The exclusive titles for the PS4 and switch are a huge reason I have both. Games like Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Uncharted, Last of Us 2, Nier. Those are all enough for me to get a console rather than a PC. Also, a bunch of my friends have PS4s so that works out.

I think the biggest aspect though is the price of entry. I know that PC gaming is cheaper overall, but it's easier for me to shell out 300-400 at a time rather than 700-800 for a PC."
45449,"Games,  games are primary case of choosing gaming system (exclusives of wii are reason I have wii, exclusives of ps3 are reason I have ps3, exclusives of switch are reason I have switch, exclusives of PS4 are reason I have ps4, emulation/mmorpg/exclusives of pc is reason I have pc (add:and ofc some games feel much better with KBM and pc power than with consoles))"
45450,"I overused my PS4, and was irresponsible with rest mode. I ended up melting it a little inside, and had to get it repaired. The fan now goes as fast as it can whenever I play games, so when I got my gaming computer, I stuck to it because of the convenient silence. Also, my computer's specs dwarf that of my PS4, and I didn't have to pay a lot in comparison to most other gaming computers. I bought it from my aunt for $800."
45451,Exclusivity influences my console choice. If that's what you're asking.
45452,My friends play on Xbox so thats what I do
45453,"Playstation, because I was led to believe that the Final Fantasy 7 remake would be coming out at some point hopefully within my lifetime"
45454,"Best controller.

It's the SNES btw...."
45455,"PC 

1) My job is in IT. So I need to be able to log in remotely to my work computer sometimes. So I might as well just overbuild the computer I have for that and also use it for gaming. 

2) Many of my favorite genres are overwhelmingly PC only (Turn based strategy, real time strategy, etc). Whereas my least favorite genre (FPS) seems to be consoles number 1 priority. 

3) I like the selection of indie/early-access games available on PC. The most popular ones often find their way to consoles, but even if I am late to the program and am buying them at the same time they come to console, they are usually heavily discounted for PC by that time. 

I don’t think PC is the right choice for everyone, but it is for me."
45456,Pc because of strategy games and management games.
45457,Friends. I don't want to play alone or with random people.
45458,"I like my pc because it's powerful, it has multiple uses, (gaming, recording music, browsing) the graphics are insane, mods, free games, old school runescape.

I like my 360 because it's convient, has guitar hero, and local multiplayer."
45459,"Sorry, I downvoted initially. I mistook 360 for Xbox One. 

With a high end PC, there's no reason to buy a brand new Xbox."
45460,"PC because it’s easier to have one set up than multiple consoles, I’ve seen the chaos of consoles because my brother collects them, plus I tend to favor games on steam and the only consoles I have are handheld, old psp, 2DS,  and Nintendo because my dad loves Nintendo and bought himself, and subsequently us, all the nintendo consoles.

Basically cause one pc has fewer cables than a dozen consoles"
45461,Great console if you enjoy racing games i suggest need for speed most wanted the original. The Fable trilogy are also great games.
45462,"The seller was kind enough to give me 3 games :)
Gta5, fifa 19 and forza horizon

Edit: i never expected this post to blow up this much. Wow!! I am shocked to see the support i received from this community. I have seen lot of people messaging me to offer some games, which is really cool to see,but for now i will stick to what i have and buy more games in the future. Also, i have seen people saying this is fake/i am posting this for karma, to be honest i dont care about the karma and always thought that reddit was a good place to show your true feeling and get great advises. I thank all of you for the good and bad messages :)"
45463,PM your address. I'll send you more games.
45464,"I'd also be happy to send you what I've got for the 360. There are a few controllers, extra power cord in case yours croaks, and a few games (Red dead, Gears 3, NHL 13, Goldeneye). All of it is unfortunately collecting dust right now, and if it would make you any happier with your new setup, that would make me very happy! Will sanitize and cover shipping, just let me know friendo. Until then, have a blast!"
45465,"I jumped before I looked carefully, didn't realize you were international! I would still happily send what I can without breaking the bank, but it will take a little longer than intended.

Let me know if you have any interest!"
45467,"Ah jeez, well we may be SOL here on getting you my stuff OP, but I would still like to help out. Feel free to shoot me a dm!"
45468,Abserlute legend bro. Shows that not everyone in this world are arse holes. I hope it works out for the kid.
45469,Somebody rang?
45470,Hahah yes bro!
45471,If need be I have a UK drive for the 360 as well as a japanese. Just a swap will do.
45472,"Easy way to get around region lock, just change your country or play offline. When the US had indie games I changed to US and if i wanted midnight releases back then I used to set to NZ"
45473,"some heroes don't wear capes, but i like to imagine you do."
45474,"u/milanistadoc and u/broadsband you are really NICE people. 

Contiuning cutting onions."
45475,"If I remember right, you don’t even need an actual address. You can send something labeled as General Delivery to the person’s nearest post office and they can pick it up with an ID. Def check Google , but I’m pretty sure I did that back in 2015 when I was living somewhere semi remote for work."
45476,That’s interesting. Quite a good idea for sending things to randoms on the internet
45477,News story tomorrow: Man gruesomely murdered after disclosing address online.
45478,This guy saved for 6 months to buy a 360 in 2020. There's gotta be more lucrative marks out there
45479,Not all of us murder for profit
45480,"Yeah, some of do it to prove a point."
45481,"Alexa, play Comanche by the Revels."
45482,"Congratulations, you doxxed yourself."
45483,r/humansbeingbros
45484,You're a saint friend. Thank you for being what makes the gaming community great.
45485,Thanks for being an awesome human

45488,Same here PM me and I can send some games too
45489,I second this man. I have games just collecting dust!
45490,You are awesome dude!
45491,"Hey dude, i found a download code for Fallout 3 from my Fallout 4 case, PM me if you want it"
45492,Take this offer OP. Fallout 3 is legendary
45494,Idk man 4 had some fuckin great gameplay.
45495,If you enjoy GTA I'd highly recommend Red Dead Redemption. It was my fav game on 360.
45496,With undead nightmare! Fantastic fun
45497,Same. Top 10 game of all time!
45498,"If you can ever get your hands on it, grab forza motorsport 4. One of the best in the series and just a great game in general"
45499,Good games congrats and have fun
45500,Skate 3!
45501,Can’t miss with Fable 2
45502,Forza and GTA could keep me busy for a years worth of playtime each
45503,"Get game ass you get over 100 ganes.

Thank you guys / gals. It was a genuine miss-typo hahaha. Play on words so to speak. But yea u get gass out yo ass so yeah . Genuine typo on purpose. Iv'e solved reddit god dam when is the trophy supposed to pop :)"
45504,"Edit. 

Lol 

Game ass?"
45505,I too love game ass
45506,"This is a typo I wouldn't change either.

I'm assuming game pass is what's meant.. but, this is reddit... Soooo... Chances are 50/50"
45507,"Game ass, when you about to get kicked for being idle so you pinch it off and deal with it later."
45508,I also advocate the Fable trilogy
45509,"Seriously, the 360 is a great console to start off with. There are so many good games that were on that console, some of them, legendary."
45510,Forza 4
45511,Fable two was best
45512,Ah fable. Love fable. Great memories s
45513,Hnnng nfsmw on 360 is my favourite racing game of all time
45514,"I LOVED Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, too bad they didn’t continue that spinoff"
45515,fable all the way holy shit
45516,Need for speed: underground is awesome too :)
45517,"GTA 5 should give you enjoyment long enough to save up for more games. The Xbox 360 is a solid first console, the games are really cheap right now."
45518,I forgot GTA V was released on the 360 too. It has lasted longer than the Xbox One at this point.
45519,I can't wait for gta V to be remastered on the ps25
45520,GTA V and Skyrim
45521,GTAV was/will be released on all platforms until the sun burns out.
45522,Was just gonna day that!  Also - GTA 4 holds up as well.
45523,"Have fun playing! 
It does not matter its an older console what matter is to enjoy it :)"
45524,"Absolutely right. I’ve been enjoying the hell out of Super Nintendo lately.

Update: Just beat Link to the Past for the first time in 28 years!"
45525,"Super Mario World is the best game ever, period"
45526,Legend of Zelda. Change my mind.
45527,"Hate to be a grammar nazi, but you misspelled Secret of Mana."
45528,"While I like them both, me and my friend have a tradition of getting hammered and beating Super Mario World (no star road) once a year. Kill it in just a few hours at this point. Been at it for 11 years, it's awesome."
45529,Thats an amazing tradition. Me and my brothers tradition is turtles in time. Haha
45530,Laughs in super metroid
45531,"Chrono trigger, earthbound, killer instinct, street fighter 2... Man... SNES was my childhood."
45532,"You should jail break it, you get access to most of the games."
45533,"Super Metroid, 100% in 6hrs. Personal goal I will never achieve but my old SNES still kicks it with my PS4"
45534,I love having a console a couple generations old. Cheap games! Waiting for the bottom to fall out of the 3ds market right now...
45536,Hey man I'll send you a Xbox One X if you'd want it
45537,"If this happens, I'll throw in an xbox one edition of GTA V plus whatever other games I have around and a 3 month code for game pass ultimate."
45539,u/deadinside6636
45540,"u/deadinside6636


Ill add some games!"
45541,Seeing stuff like this gives me hope for humanity.
45542,The cynic in me says its a ploy to exploit people's kindness.
45543,"Yea, i've seen it work too many times already.  All you have to do is post how proud you are that you've obtained something most people would take for granted, and say something like ""it's not much but I worked hard for it"", and people will just start throwing free shit at you.  Not saying this particular post is definitely a scam, but it could be."
45544,"I worked hard for my car, but it's not much.

*I could really use a new one...*"
45545,I have a Tesla lying around if you want it
45546,I’ll throw in some of these Lamborghinis I got lying around too.
45547,"Hmmm, I checked his account and he skateboards in Dubai and takes pictures in the Himalayas with an Iphone 7 plus"
45548,"They were also looking to move to New Zealand or Norway. Hardly  countries you go to if you're struggling for money. It might be genuine, but it certainly raises some flags."
45549,could be a migrant worker from india/Nepal.  Skateboarding is not an expensive hobby and iphone 7 is an old phone. don’t be so quick to judge.
45550,"I didn't judge, I gave others the information necessary to judge"
45551,10 seconds search shows that he is in fact indian and the son of a poor working family in emirates.
45552,The realist in me knows it is.
45553,"Its all good brother, i just want to enjoy my 360 at the moment and work my way up. Thank you for your generous offer tho :)"
45554,I have a load of old games on the Xbox one I have no use for If you’d like them too!
45555,"Wow, that is so cool of you man. I love seeing how the community is rallying to help out a guy who needs it."
45556,"I was just about to offer Mine!!
 Well, I do have an extra ps4 laying around......"
45557,This community is amazing to do things like this
45558,Can I have it just by asking or it doesn't work that way?
45559,"Nice! The Xbox 360 was a big part of my life for years. Can fully recommend the Fable games.

Since it's an older console, probably bought secondhand, it might be a good idea to open it up and remove the dust, making it run smoother. Have fun!"
45560,This. This here.  360s were prone to overheating and causing rrod because of the Mobo warping.  Xclamps and what not.  Keep it clean.
45561,It wasn't an issue on the slim version mostly because the removed the red led's in the ring. Most of the overheating issues was also fixed in the slim version.
45562,"The 360 was a beast, so many great games, so easy to use.

Guy's gonna have a blast!

360 is nothing to be ashamed of. Just like getting a PS4 in 10 years to play ""all the classics"" will still be super cool."
45563,"The Xbox 360 got loads of good games! I strongly recommend Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite, Red Dead Redemption, Fallout 3 and the Batman Arkham games"
45564,The Xbox 360 is a God Tier console. So many games I can't even start.
45565,Congratulations and welcome! You're going to love it! Crackdown is so much fun.
45566,"Yes love that game. 2 and 3 just didn’t capture the original to me, but the first one is gold."
45567,Dude used games for it are super cheap nowadays. You are the smartest gamer on this subreddit.
45568,"Honestly this. I have a ps4 I was lucky enough to have gifted to me. That said, I came across a used 360 for a good price a year or 2 ago. My favorite thing to look for at thrift stores are games I really wanted to play back when I couldn't afford a game system. Amazing the amount of gems I've come across for 2-4 bucks. Matter of fact, I'm gonna go play some New Vegas right now"
45569,"I'm gonna go play resident evil 5 now, thx m8"
45570,Just bought it for the switch. I know it's different than scoring it for pennies. But I'm just so excited to play it again. The wife is having difficulty getting the controls down. But it's fun.
45571,"I've honestly put probably around 500 hours into it (across having it on 360, One, and Pc) and I'm still loving it. I know it's not most people's favorite but I enjoy it very much. Not sure why I do but it is fun"
45572,"I am so overwhelmed by the support i received from this community. i have been getting lot of replies  and sorry if i am not able to reply to all. Also i have some people offering me some games they have, thank you for the offers ,but i prefer to buy the games and play it. Its the thought that counts :)"
45573,There is no shame in taking some free games from people. Most of them are probably dusted over and need some love. Accept their gifts and give those games the attention they deserve!!
45574,"it is true. i don’t even know where my xbox 360 games are but i definitely have them and have no intention of playing them again, and there are many others like me. definitely accept their gifts, there are great people out there."
45575,"I've donated most of the PS4 games I no longer played to my local library, gives people that hasn't got the biggest wallet a oppurtunity to play them for free and if I wanna play them again I can just rent them."
45576,"I mean i get that you want to feel youve earned the games, but most people are like me and have stacks of them that we'll never play again and wouldnt get much money from if we traded them in, theres no shame in opening a P.O. box and letting people send you them"
45577,"I'm still using my PS3. It doesn't matter if we don't have the newest thing, we have the joy of gaming regardless! :)"
45578,lol same. although i actually was just thinking about finally getting a new console... but now is actually a terrible time to buy them. rip
45579,"Out of curiosity how much did you pay?

I remember like 5 years ago they were going for like 50$

If never played Xbox 360 then fuck yeah your gonna have a good time for super cheap lol almost all Xbox 360 games are 5$ at game stores, hell even brand new they’re dirt cheap"
45580,I got one for $20 from a used video game store near me like 3 years ago. It was a sale and they just had like 30 stacked up.
45581,"Who do you work for, Beyoncé?"
45582,"Welcome dude, I remember when I got my 360 I loved it so much I still have it"
45583,The first game I've ever played on a 360 was Alan Wake. Highly recommend it
45584,"How much they paying you, a dollar a day?"
45585,"I am paid monthly. That is 1500 Dirham, which is 408$ i guess"
45586,"Playing a few good games on an old console is much better than owning a dozen mediocre games on a new console,it would be just better graphics not really important, it's a good thing you got games that you enjoy."
45587,"That's less than $15 a day. We're in the U.S. fighting for $15 an hour.

Puts things in perspective."
45588,"I mean you also have to take into consideration the cost of living. $15 an hour isn’t shit in NYC while this dude might be balling out there with $15/hr.

If you want perspective you need the whole picture.

Edit: made it more clear so you guys can stop telling me he’s probably not balling on $15/day....no shit."
45589,"If he had to save for a month to get it, I doubt he is balling out at $15 a day."
45590,XBOX is expensive outside of the US.I live in SEA so I feel ur pain. I would suggest in getting a PS4 because the games are way cheaper. All the older games are about $20 usd and after currency exchange ×4 in my country:( it's still affordable. Plus theres always a sale on PSN about 5 usd per game.
45591,"Cracking choice of console, massive selection of games and now beautifully cheap to buy games! 
I think overall I got more joy with my time on the 360 than the One.
What games you playing?"
45592,Enjoy it! Tons of fun games on that system. And congrats on saving money you earned to be able to treat yourself. Respect.
45593,"Bro congrats! Doesn't matter how old your machines is, the fact of the matter is you're happy! And that makes us happy as well. Enjoy your gaming my dude and good luck in the future!"
45594,"I don't understand why you're telling me this. The use of the console is for playing video games, as far as I know. Not garnering emotional support from strangers, or trying to gin up negative responses then be all butthurt. I'm poor, too. Congratulations."
45595,Wish you lived closer so I could send you some games. Enjoy!
45596,"Thats very nice of you, but its fine."
45597,How old are you?
45598,22 :)
45599,"Welcome to the console world, late comer!"
45600,"My parents weren’t rich enough to buy me anything, but i didn’t complaint. I waited until i could buy with my own money. Thanks :)"
45601,You deserve more. Enjoy!
45602,Keep up the hard work bro. I am sure your parents are proud of you.
45603,Never too late to enjoy gaming
45604,"You can get up to Halo 4 on the 360, those are great games, Halo 3 and Reach are my favorites though 4 had some great multiplayer maps and game types as well.  Call of Duty Black Ops 1 & 2 are great games on the 360 as well.  Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel are good as well."
45605,"Heck you can play Destiny, Titanfall and Rise of the Tomb raider too."
45606,"Don’t know if you’re into skateboarding or not, but Skate 3 is a fantastic game on the 360"
45607,"It was $5 a couple weeks back on the Xbox Store, hopefully it goes on sale again"
45608,"Damn I missed that, would have bought it"
45609,Xbox 360 was great! No problems with it ever!
45610,"OP I love how humble you are! Never be sorry for that! It maybe old but its yours and you worked hard for it. The fact you're proud and wanted to show that in a world where people on the Internet can be really hurtful. Well let's just say I love your character! 


Everyone's recommended so many brilliant games im sure you have a list! For me it would be resident evil 5. Not because its the best game about or even in the series. But for me it marked a time in my early 20s where me and mt friends had the laid back attitude, we would all go to one another houses, drink beer, eat crappy takeaway and just have fun. We've all grown up and got out own lives now, but that summer when it came out.. was a damn good summer!"
45611,"Pm me your address, I'll get you a PS4. Any games you particularly want?"
45612,"Hate be that guy but are you working in a sweat shop ?

You ok bud"
45613,"The 360 was the first console I'd ever bought myself, 5 or so years after it came out. I know the struggle and you made the 100% right choice. That console brought me countless hours of joy AND all 360 games are super cheap now. Seriously 15 bucks makes you king of the 360 games. I need to buy new adapters for mine because I've been really wanting to play through the Mass Effect series again.

Unrelated note, has anyone else been seeing articles about a Mass Effect remaster?"
45614,The best fallout is on that there console as well
45615,"Good for you son, work hard. Pay offs like this are sweet and you appreciate them much more. You're a good man"
45616,"Congrats man. who cares if it's an old console. consoles are consoles. hope you have fun with it

Edit: you are also super smart games for xbox 360 and ps3 are super cheap now like 5 to 10 dollars"
45617,"Get civilization revolution, Skyrim, and Borderlands 1 and 2. Great games.  They should be really cheap right now."
45618,It took you 6 months to save 50 bucks?
45619,He lives in the United Arab Emirates where wages can be much lower than minimum wage in the US
45620,Damn you are broke. You worked 6 months for 100 bucks
45621,You saved up for 6 months to buy an xbox 360? Those sell for like 50$ tho?
45622,"He said he earns about 400$ a month, so if he has to pay bills and can save about 10 bucks it would totally make sense it takes time to save up. Just don't judge anyone for the money they have. Living from month to month can be very hard"
45623,"That's fair, I've been there myself so I can't judge"
45624,Look into the crackdown series. Lots of fun on my old 360.
45625,"Look, I know piracy is frowned upon, but the fact is that the games you would buy for this have already made their money. 

If you aren't looking to play online, crack the shit out of it and enjoy your console."
45626,"Good news: you did great.

Bad news is: it doesn't end there. now you have to work to pay for the games, the Xbox live, the extras like a headset/bigger hard drive.

But better for that than for drugs huh?!

How old are you BTW and what you ve been working?"
45627,"Thanks :)

I am 22 a working student, i work as a data entry analyst."
45628,You work 2 hours a week?
45629,Welcome! Now go get Ace Combat 6!
45630,Congratulations! Lots of fun and good memories ahead of you!
45631,I had a 360 too i always needed to warm it up by playing an other game to play minecraft
45632,Im happy for you. Enjoy :)
45633,Good thing about 360 is that you can buy 360 game lots on ebay for a cheap price.
45634,"Great choice dude, that was a fantastic console. Enjoy your reward of your work"
45635,"Still has better games than the Xbox One. PS2, GameCube, and Xbox 360 have such amazing libraries of games. Youll have a blast."
45636,"I mean, you did buy the best console ever made"
45637,I still play ps1 games enjoy yourself
45638,Welcome brother! May many noobs and monsters be slain.
45639,"Hey, congrats! Have fun playing! Any games in particular you have in mind to go through?"
45640,So many good memories and so many good games on the 360. Hope you enjoy playing!
45641,"Congrats, playing the 360 with my brother and college roommates was some of my fondest memories. So many great games, and all are probably reasonably priced. The Elder Scrolls Oblivion (the best) and Skyrim (also pretty great) and the Mass Effect Trilogy are awesome, Gears of War offers some of the most fun multiplayer and co-op modes I ever played. Oh yeah, and the Bioshock games, and Assassin's Creed, and Halo, of course, and..."
45642,Get the Metal Gear Solid trilogy. Just do it.

33497,Yeah you got a point. I really hate that part but most of us are young guys and the economy is fucked. We can’t be spending the 50k new in huge numbers that automakers want for a car to be profitable.
33499,"How much is insurance for 2 cars? Lots of car enthusiast cars are the ones you can't just have without a second car. You can have a Rav4 as your sole vehicle since it's large enough to carry people and it can handle snow. If you have a miata unless you are in the south you can't just have that one car. So now you need a second. And honestly insurance is more expensive then the cars in the long run. The miata to buy now is like 300 per month for 3 years. While the insurance is 200 per month for forever.  AND you still need to buy that Crosstrek. 

So you spending 50k no matter what. 

I know this because IM CURRENTLY IN THIS SITUATION. I make decent but ANY good enthusiast car outside of like 2 (the WRX and the golf R) are rear wheel and I live in the North.

When no one can buy a house and relarionships percentage is at a low and so everyone is living by themselves you don't have the optics to buy a enthusiast car. They are fun but not practical and unless wages start to go back and houses get cheap they won't be viable choices for people"
33501,"How many apartments make you pay for a parking spot and how many parking spots do you expect me to pay for? 

Parking at my apartment is 100$. 2 cars that's 200. Insurance is 200+200. That's an extra 300 per month on top of the cost of the cars.  Just to have a car used for snow days? 

It was legit cheaper to get a BMW m240i used then to do a miata+winter beater. I'm in NY so it could be the location but it's not an easy choice. 

And that's me with the no student debt and ok salary."
33502,My NB added $18/mo to my insurance lol. Then adding a 20 year old Outback added another $13.
33503,"Society has pushed for SUVs and trucks over sedans, hence the models coming out and hence the shrinking ICE sedan market.

SUVs and trucks are easier to sneak margin markups too. Sedan R&D is probably hard to justify and cover up. Sedans would be fighting $20-30K Camrys and Accords and such, while making an EV price competitive with a $50-70K Grand Cherokee or Q5 or Equinox is easier."
33504,The NE (Electric) Miata. Would be perfect.
33505,Try for a Vanderhall Edison instead.
33506,"If you've spent anytime with the current crop of EVs this isn't surprising. Tesla really does build a better electric car than everyone else so far because they think holistically rather than trying to fit ICE thinking into a BEV. 

Having said that, you can admit that Tesla builds a phenomenal EV and still not like them. It's not all or nothing. Personal preference will always play a part."
33507,"> Tesla really does build a better electric car than everyone else so far

Not sure about ""a better electric car"" so much as ""a better electric vehicle ownership experience.""  Competitors are starting to get close to Tesla's real-world ranges, and although FSD is still among the most capable driver assist systems out there, automakers have long caught up to the capabilities of regular AutoPilot, and some are even catching FSD (ex. SuperCruise).

Tesla's greatest advantages have always been factors beyond the vehicle itself, and they remain as unchallenged as ever there despite the specs of rival EVs closing the gap.  The charging network is the best example: there's enough of them that you can roam the entire Interstate system in the lower 48 states without worry of being stranded, and it's only getting better as they continue to expand the network.  Only something on that scale can truly alleviate people's range anxiety - other automakers can claim it's an overstated concern all they want, but ultimately you should be playing around the consumer's mindset rather than trying to fight them.

The other often-touted advantages like OTA updates and the order-only purchasing model may still be Tesla-exclusive for now, but they don't require an EV to be implemented.  Other companies are already jumping on the OTA update train, and although it would take a near-herculean effort for legacies to cast off dealerships, that's pretty much the only obstacle for legacies to switch to Tesla's model."
33508,"> Competitors are starting to get close to Tesla's real-world ranges

Yea, I what it is is that nobody provides all three:

1. Costs about the same or less than a Tesla
2. Charges about as fast or faster than a Tesla
3. Has as about the same or more range than a Tesla

Mach-e does #1 and #3. Taycan does #2 and #3. Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf does #1 and #3 (if you compare to the short range Teslas).  ID.4 does #1.  Hyundai Kona does #1 and #3.

Nobody has yet hit the trifecta."
33509,">Having said that, you can admit that Tesla builds a phenomenal EV and still not like them.

Funny you should say that--that's where I'm at on the matter! 😁

I wouldn't want a car made by them but it does still seem like they're setting the standard in a lot of respects for BEVs."
33510,"In my opinion Tesla builds the best EV, but not the best car that is an EV. I've driven a Model S, which I was surprised that I didn't like, and a Model 3, which I loathed. I've sat in a Model Y which felt like it had the build quality of a Yugo, or at least what I imagine the build quality of a Yugo to be.

I want a car that feels like a car but happens to be an EV. I've had two Nissan Leafs and while they have their issues, everything is where I expect it to be and operates like I expect it to operate.

I'm intrigued by the Mach-E which seems like it might be a better EV than the Leaf and a better car than a Tesla."
33511,"> The best EV but not be best car that is an EV.

Coming from an owner, this is the best short but sweet assessment of Tesla. Other companies do *car* building better, because they have a vast amount of that experience. They make more intuitive designs, better build quality, etc. - the downside is that they also don’t dedicate all their resources to EVs and while they’re getting *extremely* competitive, it’ll take a little more time for them to catch up the the big lead Tesla had.

Tesla’s advantage is that they *only* build EVs and infrastructure, and have reap the benefits of having that be their only focus in their model lineup. The cars are top notch from an engineering standpoint, but in practice, quality control is a huge mixed bag, sometimes their designs aren’t user friendly, and their tech company first mentality means you have to be ready to put up with their way of “doing things just because we can,” (and the company is run like a dumpster fire).

Teslas are great if you want cutting edge but are willing to put up with crap for it. Other brands are great if you *just want a car, that does car things like your previous cars, but an EV* and are okay with being a bit behind cutting edge."
33512,Yeah they probably build the best overall EV *if nothing goes wrong*. It's kinda like how the Giulia is the best sports sedan except if you actually have to own it
33513,"While reading the article I found something that invalidated the results for me. The Tesla drivers rolled along with the HVAC off in 65F weather and endured 86F in the cabin. Those traveling with heat-sensitive passengers like babies in car seats and diapers will not tolerate this experience well. C&D's article made no mention of HVAC settings other than the above, thus leaving us all in the dark.

EE didn't address this energy-saving aspect in his charts either, so he joined the obfuscation club as well.

To me, we are at a point where real-world usage must be depicted in these reviews/media. Tesla's been slinging EVs out the door for a decade now. The Leaf is how old now, 7 years or so? 

I'm not sure what the EPA uses for HVAC settings but I hazard that 70F in winter and 75F in summer is reasonable. I'd love to see the results of C&D's 1,000 mile trip using the above settings. As a potential EV buyer in 3 years this is the kind of info I need, how will the EV behave when I use one? 

Rant incoming - And yes, I would expect this demand would help push back against the glass roofs that are fashionable/unavoidable right now as the thermal gain of these will matter in this kind of standardized testing. I would love to see the impact on driver fatigue found with the overhead glare caused by glass roofs and the current fashion of flat screens/shiny plastic/chrome bits in the center consoles. The blinding we receive is a road hazard, much like phone screens in use by the front seat passenger."
33514,"Anecdotal data, but in our ID.3 if you have the AC targeting 18C/65F on a warm sunny day then the power usage shows it drawing 1kw just to run that.

That is while stopped at a stop light so zero drive power usage.

Setting to a few degrees warmer can cut that to 0.2kw easily though, the usage is very non linear."
33515,That is more data than I've read on this matter to date. Thank you for this.
33516,"Thinking about the numbers, we have a 56kwh battery which probably lasts for 6-7 hours of varied driving. So that is averaging 8kw for drive during that time.

AC on max then effectively cuts your range by 12-15%, which is significant."
33517,"Thank you, that's what my concerns were, range reductions.

I get wanting to not make a big deal about this during the early adoption phase of EVs. We don't want to scare folks away before things get rolling. Is it still too early to speak of this limitation?"
33518,"I have never driven my EV on a journey for 7 hours straight where it would be an issue. 

However, I do live in the middle of the UK where you fall in the ocean if you drive 7 hours in any direction...

And chargers here are not that rare that it would cause any major anxiety. I'd rather drive in comfort and stop 30 mins sooner if I needed to. But so far I have charged the car a total of twice away from my house in 4 months of ownership. Most journeys just aren't that far."
33519,"So we are to the point where a little short of a 'work day' of driving is doable in today's EVs.

In the US you can drive for 7 hours east or west and stay in the same time zone, and we have 4 zones across the lower 48 states. So going cross-country is possible, and maybe more safe due to more mandatory stops to recharge, which means the driver could refresh more frequently."
33520,"Yeah I agree that outside of major urban centres it is pushing the limits of acceptable to own an EV in the US currently. They work much better in smaller more densely populated countries.

A 2 hour commute each way is unheard of over here. The only time I travel 2 hours for work is when I have to go to London to meet a client!"
33521,"They all had the same choices and options, it was a race after. hvac use wouldn't have changed the outcome."
33522,">hvac use wouldn't have changed the outcome.

Probably not the order of finish but wouldn't it have affected recharging needs and thus delayed the finish?

Either way we don't have the info on the other drivers' HVAC use so can't compare, unless C&D cares to elaborate.

So my assumption of this event being not as helpful as it could be is correct?"
33523,Hvac over the what 13 hours if driving probably would add 10-15kwh of energy and 5-10min on extra charging time max
33524,When you put it like that then being comfortable isn't a big factor in normal use.
33525,Crazy how EE negative tesla videos get up voted like crazy here yet...
33526,It's a biased subreddit. 99% of the comments are about 1% of cars sold. You will get similar excitement posting about soundbars on /r/audiophile or Razer keyboards on /r/mechanicalkeyboards.
33527,Try bringing up soundbars on /r/HomeTheater
33528,They even have an automod to [rant about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/ombxqo/beginner_with_some_questions_upgrading_from/h5jvrg0/) when they're mentioned in an OP; it's actually kind of amusing.
33529,"Yeah. I thought the video was very fair and interesting. Unfortunate to see that it's been downvoted to zero.

Ah, well, whatever.

TBH, I was *most* impressed by how well Porsche did."
33530,"Yeah they seem decent efficient and fast charging, the architecture good

And despite its crap efficiency the etron does ok so long as you have well placed 150kw chargers"
33531,Don’t worry everyone insists there’s no bias against Tesla here.
33532,"Interesting video.

Tesla is for sure holding it's value in terms of performance.

However, the rest of the industry is starting to sink their claws in. The mustang being the first real competition with the Ford Lightning being the next. 

In 5 years Tesla is going to be even or worse most likely. Then they're gonna have to compete with warranty and actual car stuff. 

A lot of less optimal things in a Tesla are still way behind actual car manufacturers. See interiors."
33533,">The mustang being the first real competition

Wouldn't that honor fall on the Taycan as the Model S's first *real* competitor?

The Mach E would definitely be the Model 3's, though."
33534,I mean for the general public lol. The taycan is like 80-90k?
33535,"The cheapest Model S right now, the Long Range, is $84,990--that ain't exactly cheap."
33536,"Right...?

And in saying the Mustang is the first competitor the general public will buy."
33537,Sigh. I feel like I hear more about EVs these days than regular cars.
33538,"Pretty much every car will be electric in 10 years time (in some way).

They will be the new regular car, that's why your hearing a lot about them."
33539,It’s because it’s basically been the biggest topic in cars in the last decade
33540,"It is, unfortunately, the future. Unless we can somehow make carbon-neutral gasoline economical ([which is evidently unlikely](https://youtu.be/0d0MPg7DxbY))."
33541,I had a tesla try to keep up in my gasoline car let's just say I'll never be buying one after seeing how a tesla can lose power going a decent speed for a long time.. shoot I've never had that problem in my gasoline powered car lol.. just having pure hate haha
33542,If your gasoline car is an outback XT you’re lying lol
33543,"I own this car. I have the Pro S version. It's my 4th EV and by far my favorite. My husband has a Model 3 LR. The ID.4 doesn't charge as fast as the Model 3, but it does 10-80% in about 38 min, which is SO much faster than the Bolt I owned. Although, I normally just charge at home on our L2 so it's not a huge deal. When on trips it takes a good bit of time to go in to use the bathroom, order food and eat so the 38 min is no big deal either. The ride is so much more comfortable, especially with passengers in the back. I've been getting about 3.6 kWh but I've also been driving in B Eco mode and have been driving EVs since 2011 and have learned how to maximize efficiency. I will say in my previous EVs I didn't use the heat and air as much to get this rate, but I have the air on in the ID.4. To date I'm getting about 280 miles when charged to 100%. Although I typically don't charge over 80% unless I'm going on a trip. I also don't drive over 70mph on the highway. I can't say enough great things about this car. The one negative is the Car-Net App is certainly lacking compared to the Bolt and the Tesla Apps, but I hear they are working on that."
33544,"Having test driven the ID.4 single motor I have to say that I was really impressed with it. The auto reviewers have made it out to seem so mediocre that it completely smashed those expectations. For $31k for the base model here in California after tax credits it’s an insanely good value. This is a vehicle for people coming from ICE RAV4’s, CR-V’s etc. looking to buy their first EV. And the ID.4 is a lot nicer than the RAV4 I rented."
33545,"That's so good to hear. I have been patiently waiting for someone to crack to code on how to get normal people to buy EVs, and I really hope VW does it with this model. I like that they actually advertise it as well. Every other legacy OEM that has EV's clearly does not actually want to sell them in high volume. Hopefully VW can sell millions and millions worldwide and actually make a dent in the ICE fleet over the next decade."
33546,">	The ride is so much more comfortable, especially with passengers in the back. I've been getting about 3.6 kWh but I've also been driving in B Eco mode and have been driving EVs since 2011 and have learned how to maximize efficiency.

I’ve discovered recently that unless you’re in a city, the best mode is D mode and then let the car coast to a light or exit. I added a lot of range and it was a much easier drive…I encourage you to try it, with and without ACC, and you’ll likely never go back to B mode. 

I mentioned ACC - if you are on slower roads (80kph/50mph) like me and have circles where traffic mixes, I find without ACC better. One the footpedal light comes on in the binnacle display over the steering wheel, let off the gas — it knows the distance to the circle and all that lovely regen comes flooding back, much more than if you raced to it and braked."
33547,"The host is incorrect in stating Teslas (with Panasonic cells) charge 20 minutes faster from 10-80%, the actual difference is ~10 minutes. Otherwise a good review."
33548,Maybe he counted also the time to find the only one of four working fast charger and make the payment.
33549,2018 called they want their joke back.
33550,Unfortunately not - see this from 14 hours ago - https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/o4ly00/3\_of\_a\_kind\_at\_ea\_charging\_today/
33551,So they got free electricity. Ooh.
33552,"You didn’t read. You suggested that charger problems are a thing of the past, I linked you a less than day old post where three vehicles rolled into an EA charger and none of them could charge. Just getting you up to date - still sucks."
33553,"I'm perfectly up to date, but thanks for the concern. EA works flawlessly for me, 40 times now, three times yesterday alone. Don't need the fake news."
33554,"Charging speeds will be about 500km/h for the ID.4, 575km/h for the Standard Range Model Y, and about 700km/h for a Long Range Model Y on a v2 charger, and 900km/h on a v3. These are 10-80% averages, using EV Database figures, with the Model Y the same as Model 3 but downrated 5% for the reduced efficiency.

So the Model Y can charge at almost twice the speed, but only the model which costs a lot more, and only at v3 chargers."
33555,"> but only the model which costs a lot more

The Model Y Standard Range isn't technically sold (though apparently you can get them if you call) and doesn't have a price.  All Model Y's have the long range battery.  The 60 kWh is only sold on the Model 3.

And yeah, I don't understand the quibbling here.  Indeed per numbers at ev-database the Tesla charging system sinks about 70% more power, or (because of somewhat higher efficiency) 86% higher rate of  recovered range.  The article seems spot on to me.  The ID.4 isn't really that impressive as a vehicle, but a crossover at $40k is pretty attractive for a lot of market segments.

That's not completely surprising for a vehicle that costs 30% more."
33556,"On this criteria it’s about as impressive as a Model 3 SR+, with a slightly longer range and a slightly slower charge speed. Both the standard range Teslas and the ID.4 are only about 30-45m slower than the long range Teslas over 10 hours of driving, to 1000km. Given the price point and the form factor it seems impressive to me."
33557,It’s interesting that for someone with “no brands wars” as their flair you certainly do like to highlight the differences when it doesn’t favour Tesla
33558,Interesting that a Tesla fan thinks that objective factual information is an attack on their brand.
33559,"My point was that it doesn’t need to be discussed. I didn’t say it was an attack.

Saying “no brand wars” but spending your time pointing out differences is what creates brand wars.

No one needed to discuss Tesla.

What’s been obvious for a while is those who dislike Tesla the most bring it up at every opportunity.

This is a post about the Id4 let the comments celebrate the car"
33560,"Did you watch the video? Boja is correcting misinformation in the video, misinformation which happens to make Tesla look better than it is by comparison. By Cunningham's law, it must be corrected here in the comments."
33561,"Riddle me this. “No brand wars” guy have a look at what brands he always shits on. It’s only one singular brand. Pro everything else, shits on one. Causes fights about one. The irony of “no brand wars”."
33562,"I don't really care to analyze someone's post history. I'm just commenting on the absurdity of getting upset over someone correcting some basic misinformation in a very neutral manner.

I guess if you're always on defense, everything looks like an attack though."
33563,">	don’t really care to analyze someone’s post history

Perhaps you should. Then you realise that some people can never be fair, they can’t never acknowledge a positive thing. That for this guy he can only have one position on a certain topic. So his entire motivation to post and comment is to bring that up.

He’s creating a brand war every comment"
33564,"u/Bojarow is pretty knowledgeable and objective in my view. Mostly sticks to interesting tidbits of info that others miss, and clarifying things. Strong member of the sub for sure. Do they have a bias against Tesla? Maybe, I'm not the final word on anything, but nothing imo worth getting upset about and certainly not in a toxic way.

If you read my history you'll probably think I'm some anti-Tesla type too. And maybe I am, who knows. I personally think Elon is a lunatic and there's a small but vocal minority of Tesla fans online that make it difficult to have normal discussions. I also think Tesla does some really cool stuff and I'm very glad they exist and are pushing EVs forward in their own way. I'll never forget the first time I drove one - I was grinning ear to ear for a week (and I used to ride motorcycles and had a BMW, so I'm vaguely familiar with speed). I just don't let that singular experience result in unquestioning loyalty.

I think we're all a lot more alike than different and we all want to see more BEV and less ICE. Cheers."
33565,">	I think we’re all a lot more alike than different and we all want to see more BEV and less ICE. Cheers.

33583,"Base price $40k before $7500 tax credit and possible state tax credit. In other words, a $31-32k EV crossover (for many) with an 82kWh battery is getting competitive with ICE. Having driven ID.4 it’s a lot nicer than the RAV4 I rented."
33584,Almost anything drives better than a RAV4. May be the worst car I've ever driven.
33585,"I didn’t think the RAV4 was bad. It’s one of the best ICE crossovers in that price range. It just can’t compete with the ID.4 driving experience IMO which is smoother, quieter and quicker off the line. Plus, the ID.4 has a nicer interior."
33586,The numbers
33587,"In EU, specificly in Finland these ID4 type of cars are +45k€ spartan model.. actual price 50k€ with some features.. government credit 2000€ this is insane difference in the price for same product."
33588,"ID4 might be one of the best ""price for car"" vehicle. To see ""real life"" small turning circle in action really show what this vehicle can do.  0-60 in 7.3 seconds isn't bad.  And for another $3680, you can get AWD that does 0-60 in 5.7 seconds.  I think the comparison to Model Y is fair.  Model Y certainly is a better performing vehicle and have some other advantages ie. supercharging network, UI, longer range, etc. Those that can't afford to or just simply don't want to pay $53690 (including destination) + TTL, then ID4 is not a bad alternative: some advantages with ID4: better ride quality, blind spot monitor on mirrors, higher ground clearance, tighter turning circle, free fast charging at EA for 3 years, etc.  So it depends what a person wants."

33599,It sucks being under 25. I need to borrow a friend or family members vehicle. No car rentals for me.

They'll charge off a standard 110v outlet as long as it's at least 15A (most are). I've never ran mine so low that it didn't have enough charge to cover my next day. However, a full charge is around 23 hours. I think the 2017 leaf has 150 mile range and would be cheaper than a bolt."

33603,"I'd pref below $20,000. I was considering saving for the new Corolla Hybrid but am more on the fuck gas entirely side. Work is currently 12 miles total but my office is moving to within two miles from me. Hanging out with my girlfriend is between 18-30 miles total. I'm looking at the possible 80 Range. I don't have a charger yet as my family is skeptical of electric vehicles but I can get one installed, I just need to research more about it. Workplace charging isn't available, size can be any as I'm 22 and mostly just drive with my girlfriend in the family car. AWD is nice but not completely needed. Currently not considering road trips as I would probably take the train for long road trips rather than the car."
33604,"First off-I love your anti gas attitude. I’m right there with you. Based on your needs, id go for a used Bolt. They go for under $20k at just 3 years old. It’s a pretty practical commuter with decent range (238 miles) and charging (50kW) for regional trips if needed. All EVs have good warranty that go for 8 or 10 years depending on the State you live in. You could probably get by with Level 1 (120v or a regular outlet) overnight as it will give you about 60 miles range overnight. That charger comes with the car. Upgrading to Level 2 will cost you a few hundred. You won’t regret going EV."
33605,"/u/zercuits - I agree with this, seeing quite a few Bolts on auto tempest under 20k:
https://www.autotempest.com/results?make=chevrolet&model=bolt

And since it has pretty good range you could drive it back from almost anywhere:

33606,"My $.02 — You don’t drive very many miles per day.  If I were you I would get a 2015 Nissan Leaf or 2015 Volkswagen E-golf.   The leaf has better comforts such as a heated steering wheel (SL trim) and cell phone connectivity.  The E-Golf is a better driving vehicle and is made with seemingly higher quality materials.

I would also skip the level 2 charger at home for now.  Just charge level 1 off the standard outlet- your miles driven doesn’t warrant a need for level 2 installation.  You can always install in the future if overnight charging L1 isn’t working well enough for you."
33607,well cared-for used volts come in way under your 20k limit and will let you do the vast majority of your driving on ev and not have to rent a car if you have to go out of town.
33608,My only complaint with the Volt is it uses gas in winter. Any weather below freezing is engine running due to temperature. And around here that's about 5 months of the year.
33609,"yarr.  you can set the engine run due to temperature to deferred, which will only run it under 15F.  when it does run, it burns between .03 and .1 gal."
33610,"I don't think that's an option on our 2012. And in addition, we still have 4 months of the year below 15f so it wouldn't help much. For those months the Volt averages about 6l/100km."
33611,"I hate the ERDTT.  I live in an area with a 4 months well below freezing, with much of it being 0-15 F.  I hate having a full charge but have my engine run, and also having it kick on every few miles down the highway.

If you're interested, there's an unreliable app on your phone that can connect to an OBD2 reader and prevent the engine from running."
33612,do you have a garage?  if it's warm when you leave you might cut that in half :)
33613,We have a garage but can't precondition the car in there because it runs the gas engine even when plugged in.
33614,an unheated garage then?
33615,Yeah it's not heated. I think it would cost more than the gas to keep the garage heated.
33617,Can you point me to any great defeats that I could do myself? Right now I use an app that is pretty finicky.
33619,Fair enough. I don't mind it when I need heat either.
33620,"If you're driving less than 40 miles per day, you can get away with a 120V charger. But, as others have pointed out, a Level 2 charger just plugs into a dryer/stove/RV outlet so it's usually not a big deal.

If you don't plan on road tripping any time soon, then pretty much any EV will work well. The Spark EV is hilariously torquey. The e-Golf is well-polished. The Soul EV is underrated.

If you want to go on the occasional road trip, then things get tricky. If you look hard enough, you can find a Bolt under $20k. The Ioniq's efficiency and charge speed put it on the ""road trippable"" list, too.

For my money, the best EV under $20k would be a 2015 BMW i3 REx for $16k. It might look like the south end of a northbound bulldog, but it's delightfully quick, handles like a mini cooper, and the optional range extender engine can buy you a country getaway or two."
33621,"A leaf sounds like a good option for you for commuting and general errand running. You probably can just make do with a regular outlet.

Oh and if your work is moving to just 2 miles over, have yo considered biking?"
33622,Bicycle to work when it moves closer to you.
33623,"Spark ev has active cooling, and no battery issues/degration"
33624,"Hey OP, we have a 2016 Leaf SV (with the 30kwh battery) and have daily driven it since April 2016. It has about 28000 miles.

It gets driven to work daily, 22 miles round trip, with about 2/3 of that being freeway (60+ mph). When it gets home it is at about 77% battery left.

We used the included ""Level 1"" trickle charger that came with the car for about six months, before getting a 220v outlet put in so we could use a Level 2 charger. We use a Siemens EVSE, which I'll not review since it belongs to and features are managed by my electric utility (as part of a study).

We have charged to 100% every day, and our range has not been degrading, or at least we haven't noticed. At full charge, the guessometer still says about 110 miles. We are not missing any bars yet.

City driving will maximize that range.  Hills use the battery charge faster (no, you won't get all of it back going down the other side, but some).  Freeway speeds also eat up battery charge compared to City driving. 

Day trips 50 miles away by highway are a coin flip whether it will make it back for the return leg without charging.  We use our ICE for those or we plan to charge if it's more than 30 miles away. The level 1 charger is fine for overnight charging at a hotel or campground, but you'll want to get permission first.

Road trips are not what this car was made for. I'm in Washington state, and going cross state is still pretty tedious thanks to the rate of expenditure at highway speeds. We use our ICE for those trips too.

Maintenance is excellent. I replaced the cabin air filter this Spring, and we have purchased one set of tires.  I recommend staying on top of tire rotations, because the torquey front wheels have worn through a lot faster than the rears.

Our lease is up in April, and we are planning to buy the car out for residual. We love it. I hope you do too!"
33625,"Assuming you have a good paying job I highly recommend going with Tesla if you want the best EV experience. 

Check out http://EV-CPO.com if you want to go with a used S.

The SR+ Model 3 is also a great car with good range."
33626,"As a recent college graduate, your biggest concern is probably wanting to move away from your parents, causing you to lose access to a place you can charge at home."
33627,"My first car (that I paid for) is a model 3. 

Only cost me $1k to have an electrician run a line to keep it charged and since then I've made back $2k in gas savings.

Worth it."
33628,"Almost any EV will work for your use case. I'm on my second Spark EV (first was a lease) and they've been great. If you can find a 2016 or newer Leaf they have the larger battery. I'd avoid Fiat because Fiat and also these are very small (coming from a Spark EV driver, I know small when I see it). BMW i3 with or without REX. If you don't need it, the REX apparently is the main thing that breaks on those cars. Bolt is another possibility, but costs more.

Get a 240V level 2 charger, at least 25 amps. You don't need it immediately as you can get by with 120V level 1, but you will like it better on days when you were out late the night before and have to leave early. Also, charging at 240V uses less electricity than 120V because there are some fixed losses in the process and the 240V has more left over to actually go into the battery."
33629,Fiat has a liquid cooled battery but no fast charge.  I think older models should last longer than a leaf.
33630,"Chevy Spark is a good Leaf alternative with similar range, but none of the battery problems (since it has liquid cooling for the battery pack). It can also be had for comparably cheap prices on the used market."
33631,I meant to drive in a leaf and bought one as my first car after passing. Love it. I recommend test driving a free and seeing what you like most
33632,Go pure electric. Get the newest model Leaf or BMW you can afford. You will love it.
33634,"""Everyone should buy an EV yesterday"" people are annoying, but I'd argue the ""EVs are doomed to fail because the can't handle my 800-mile daily commute on a single charge, and there's no charging infrastructure a day's drive from civilization, which is where I live"" people are worse."
33635,"I think they're doomed to succeed, and I **really loathe** that."
33636,"I'm sure niche products will continue to be made and sold to those who can afford them.

I don't see why you should hate or fear the success of something that can help us hand the planet on to future generations."
33637,"Because I hate electric cars lol. I'm not going to enjoy seeing cars, I'm not going to be able to watch racing, I probably won't be able to race either because electric will start to become superior, eventually."
33638,"There will be likely be race classes using ICE for a looong time. NASCAR is still carburated, when the US market hasn't been for several decades.

Vintage rally and racing is still a thing too."
33639,"Negative, NASCAR is fuel injected as of 2012. Throttle body injection, but still."
33640,"Well heck, shows how much I keep up with it these days!"
33641,"Yeah, but all the best series will fully switch over. Most classic racing is more like showlaps than racing anyway.

I get that it's better for everyone that we switch. I just hate it."
33642,"You'll be able to do all of those things.

No one is going to pry your cars out of your hands, and it looks like you can afford a little more tax to pay for your hobbies. Which is fair, given the costs."
33643,"I love the idea of a small fun electric car for around town shopping stuff, and a truck/suv for longer drives, more people, and towing toys."
33644,"I’m cautiously hyped for the 2020 Soul EV, the range increase it’s getting is enough for me to justify as an everyday commuter."
33645,"My commute is 12 miles one way. If I had a place to plug-in, I’d absolutely buy a small ev. 

But I don’t, I plan for my next car to be a hybrid."
33646,"12 miles one way? 


You don't need a place to plug that in. You can hit up a charging station once a week, just like getting gas, and you'd never be running low on range. 

12 miles one way is not a concern for any long-range EV."
33647,"Big issue for me is either getting into work butts early to grab one of the chargers there, or having to go a few miles out of the way of my commute to hit up a charging station for however long that takes. With my gas car I can stop at one of the many options right along the way either going in or going home."
33648,If you can find one. Kia plans to sell only a few hundred ev niros. I'd be shocked if they mass produce the ev soul.
33649,They’ve been hyping it up pretty big given that it’s getting a huge range bump. I’m cautiously optimistic but worst comes to worst I’ll just wait a few more years for a Taycan.
33650,Haha or the ipace... Or etron.
33651,Your small fun electric car might end up a shitton better at towing stuff than your SUV...
33652,">they also have insurmountable limitations for other situations/lifestyles

What do you see as insurmountable?"
33654,"> insurmountable

Too strong a word man. All these things are bing worked on. Have you seen the Rivian? Looking at the platform they have given a lot of extra space to storage capacity. They could flip it all to an extended range vehicle. Plus charging stations are going up all the time even in Rural areas. It's being surmounted just takes time."
33655,"Totally agree that an EV wouldn't work for that kind of situation. I do some rural drives where there is no charging and I have to do almost 300 miles on a charge. It's not easy..

But on a normal route with L3 charging, a 9 hour trip becomes a 10:00-10:25 hour trip. So like you said, infrastructure expansion really seems to be the big thing right now, and it seems solvable. On the other hand, I welcome the breaks, so the downtime is no problem."
33656,"Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the new Rivian and Tesla trucks? I own an F150, and will drive it until it dies, but some of these new electric trucks are pretty enticing as the replacement. An individual motor with instant torque for each wheel is pretty cool for off roading situations"
33657,"I dd a 1500 and I fully agree. I've often fantasized about buying a used Leaf but my truck is too damn useful, especially for work."
33658,I mean for me an EV wont work because they lack the noise and smells that larger displacement v8s have.
33659,Waiting for them to be cheaper but I would get one for commuting.
33660,"At this point, I think it depends on where you live. I live in the rural midwest and without any meaningful infrastructure, I wouldn't consider one."
33661,"Rural MN here. My Tesla is almost perfect for my needs. 135 mile round-trip commute+charging in my garage means no more additional trips to Casey's 2-3x a week. I honestly think rural America is going to surprise a lot of people with how rapidly we adopt EVs, especially as prices come down and the used market gets more fleshed out.

The charging infrastructure is already good enough for my needs. We took a family trip to Omaha over Memorial Day weekend just fine thanks to Superchargers.

The only rural midwest place where you might have trouble is ND but they've already got permits for superchargers on I-94."
33662,"Minnesota doesn't look too bad. I looked up on openchargemap and only see two >=40kW chargers in Iowa that are public and not Tesla restricted. I'm not knowledgeable about electric cars so maybe that's not an apt analysis. 

Even with a Tesla, that only adds a few along I80 and one by Iowa Falls on I35.

I can look at the map and see several trips I make that I couldn't make in a regular electric car like an Ioniq Electric. With a Model 3, some more would be doable, but not all.

We're getting there, though."
33663,"IA is about on-par with MN for charging at least for Teslas. And worrying about fast charging availability is a gas engine habit/worry. You'll no longer be 100% dependent on someone else for range. 95% of the time I rely on my garage. That's no small benefit. Over time the whole ""I can fill a tank in minutes"" feels to me like a cheap part trick or consolation prize for all the things my old ICE vehicles couldn't do that my Tesla can."
33664,It's on par if you're traveling down i80. Otherwise you're pretty limited. I guess it depends on whether you'll be driving long distances away from major interstates.

33667,"For Tesla, the Superchargers are all (generally, there may be exceptions) at least 6 stations per location, so the locations are what's important. With the other networks, often times there's only 1 station at each location, meaning if you're the second car to arrive, you've got to wait. That's less of an issue with Superchargers.

The Superchargers are super convenient as well, as no apps are needed, you just plug in and charge. The car nav also tells you where to stop and for how long at each stop.

I've done a bit of midwest road tripping in my Model 3 so far and I'm loving the experience.

The UP of Michigan and I-94 west of MSP are issues, though. They're working on fixing them by the end of this year it looks like given how fast the construction has been going and permits getting pulled."
33668,"Yeah, I think what I've learned today is that Tesla would be the way to go. There's still some limitations away from major interstates, but it looks great if you're not planning on trips into deeply rural areas."
33669,It seems like the optimal commuter is an EV.
33670,"Yep. They're cheap as hell, too with CA incentives. I've been really tempted by an e-Golf with the physical gauges. It's just a shame that there isn't a fun one yet."
33671,Oh man. e-golf GTI or R would be sweet im sure. Or maybe a S3 e-tron
33673,The Countryman is the only EV in the US market.
33675,Ooh that might be good. I might get that when it comes out. It also gives me an excuse to replace my current Mini with a 500 Abarth :P
33676,"I like the plug-in hybrids more.

Dont need a big engine. I dont want to pollute the city when I'm there, but I also dont want to charge every 400km's. 

A small NA engine plus an electric battery with around ~100km inside it, recharging with breaking power.

The dream."
33677,"Honestly, I'd love a plug-in hybrid F150 with like 20 miles of electric range (at zero load). The current 2.7EB engine combined with a 150hp/200lb-ft electric assist would be pretty much the ideal powertrain."
33678,"like: instant torque, lower maintenance(in theory due to fewer components), breaking away from big oil, better for our planet etc.

don't like: limited EV options as of today. it's either tesla or some econobox. yes audi and porsche are coming but they're not available and we don't know how good they are yet."
33679,"I'll be honest, I drove a Model 3 Performance and all of the competition (Giulia Quadrifoglio, M3, ATS-V, and C63S), and the 3 to me is a better overall experience than the ATS-V and M3. The C63S sounds amazing, and the Giulia both sounds amazing and is super playful + nice looking, so I'd probably take one of those if they were similarly priced. 

However, at a $20k difference in MSRP after tax credits, the Model 3 Performance is an insane value. Handling is surprisingly solid, acceleration is like no other to 60, interior is pretty cool, and the autopilot is amazing. I've heard track mode makes the car even better, but I didn't get to drive with it on.

If I could get a couple year old one and had a place to charge, I'd already have a P3D, but unfortunately there are very few used and they still go for a lot of money so I'm currently leaning towards a rwd ICE car such as the C63S or Camaro SS 1LE(if I decide to go sports car with no space)."
33680,"Yeah, getting a used one could be a good play - they're supposed to be rated at 500k+ (or was it 750k?) miles, so once the initial depreciation hits it should be a solid value (which it is already)."
33681,"Yeah they are great value even as is, but I don't want to drop 60ish k after tax credits to get one with FSD right now haha."
33682,"Exactly why I pulled the trigger on mine, zero regrets. It's a monster."
33683,They are holding their value really really well. You might only get 20% off after 3 years.
33684,"I doubt that will be true, but we'll see. The reason it looks like they are holding so well is because they have been discounted a few times now. 

If you bought a Model 3 Performance with the so called performance package, you'd pay $69,000 in August 2018. Today, that same vehicle with the package included is only $59,900. 

I doubt they will get discounted much from here on out, but if I bought mine before one of the huge price drops I'd be pretty upset."
33685,"In august there was a 7.5k tax credit. Today, it's half that. 
I guess we'll have to wait and see. Tesla cars have held their value better than all of their competition."
33686,"I don't know about all of their competition, but I also don't want to spend the time looking at car values so I'll assume that's true. I think now that competition is coming, the depreciation will be higher."
33687,"Isn't a lot of the issue going to be when the battery goes?

And isn't getting them fixed extremely painful and long?"
33688,"Warrantied to 100k miles if there is a failure like a short or a failed battery module. Degradation has been pretty good for Tesla batteries (around 5-10% after 100k miles). The battery should last around \~300k miles.

Replacement is probably a \~6 hour job (no different than changing a transmission), outside of the cost of the battery (which we don't really know how much a new battery in a model 3 will cost). They say a battery module (not the entire battery) will cost 3-7k to replace. Whatever that means.

Honestly, it seems pretty similar to if a transmission or an engine goes in a 3 series. So it's right up the ball park. I feel like I'm getting my moneys worth with this car."
33689,"My lifestyle right now is 1) renting an apartment and 2) regularly driving between Chicago and Detroit

Due to the lack of the possibility of installing a home charger, and the range of my trip exceeding most (if not all?) EVs it is not practical for me.

If it were a better fit I'd probably at least consider one (before we talk about price anyway)"
33691,"I have yet to see this anywhere in Austin, TX and Austin is a tech city with tons of EVs and is also building new apartments every other block. I wish what you said was the case but it's not a reality where I am"
33692,"New apartments near me just put in 6 chargers that are free to residents.

Charge over night every few days (depending on how much you drive)."
33693,"Pricing aside, I'm pretty sure a long-range Model S would handle that no problem. Especially with the new front motor and a Supercharger or two along the way."
33694,"Yeah, looks like the Tesla is the only option with a comfortable margin on the distance. The new drivetrain would definitely do it, 370 mi range vs a 281 mi drive."
33695,"I drive between Detroit and Chicago regularly. There are Superchargers on I-94 in Ann Arbor, Marshall, and St. Joseph. St. Joseph Supercharger has a Moe's, a Five Guys, a Froyo place, and a Panera so it's the perfect stop for the 20 minutes you need to get to/from Chicago. 

I have the 264 mile Mid Range RWD Model 3 and it's a breeze to do Detroit-Chicago."
33696,"there are literally 10 superchargers between Chicago and Detroit. That's a short stop to go to the bathroom, buy a snack, stretch your legs, and you are back at enough charge to not worry about it."
33698,"Battery degradation on everything but the Leaf (bc the Leaf has no thermal management) hasn't been an issue.

Even long distance trips are a non-issue with Teslas, less so with other EVs. 

I have a Mid Range RWD Model 3 and couldn't be happier."
33699,"There are perfectly good reasons people can have for not liking EVs and several people have made this clear in their comments. If you're down voting them simply for having opinions, you're no better than a rabid fanboi. This is a perfectly good topic of conversation, don't send people to the bottom just because you're in love with daddy elon.

Edit: this isn't directed at OP btw"
33700,"As a Model 3 owner, I think there are plenty of good reasons why people don't yet see EV's being suitable for their lives. I'm not as certain why people would generally just *dislike* the technology as a whole."
33701,"They're the future of passenger cars. For me it comes down to how my car was made with two main goals of having more than 200 miles of range and a battery that can be quick-charged for road trips. Well, a battery that can charge quick also *discharges* quick so they throw on a powerful motor to handle the discharge and I get 0-60 in 5.1s when all I really wanted was something dramatically more efficient than a 30mpg compact. To compete on efficiency an ICE with that kind of acceleration needs to do all sorts of complicated things that amount to *not* using the engine: shut off during decel and idle, shut off extra cylendars, *augment the powertrain with an electric motor*. With an EV the more efficient you make it the better it gets. With an ICE you have to make it more complicated and sometimes less powerful to get efficiency. All the future potential is heavily weighted toward EV.

They will take getting used to and a change of habit but overall my life is far better in an EV than an ICE especially as I'm rural with a longer commute. No more extra stop for gas 2-3x a week as a full charge every morning from home is plenty of range.

Even on this sub I've seen enthusiasts say ""I can see getting one for commuting but I'll keep my ICE sports car for weekends."" Well, that already admits that EVs will be the *dominant* car for transportation. If ICEs become just your weekend toy the industry as a whole will no longer be able to rely on ICE sales and the switch to EV will be on."
33702,"They're alright, I guess"
33703,"I like them but they have limitations. I leased a Fiat 500e for 3 years and it was a great experience within its limitations. It was good enough that I had a deposit down on a Hyundai Kona Electric. The 260 miles of range and fast-charge capabilities would have solved most of the issues I had with the 500e. Unfortunately all the Hyundai dealers around here are using the limited availability to tack on $7.5k+ of ""market adjustments"" and other crap to get more money out of the buyer. I simply couldn't justify the roughly $55k MSRP for a car that's identically equipped as the $25k model right next to it with the different drivetrain. If I'm going to spend that kind of money I want nicer materials, design, and fit & finish."
33704,"Totally with you on the dealer markups. Have you looked at the Bolt or the Model 3? I love both of those as well, but the Bolt is a worse road-tripper for sure."
33705,"I'd been looking into a Bolt for a while before the Kona actually. I wasn't a fan of the funky shape and plastic interior but on paper it's still good. It kind of became a victim of what happened with the Kona which soured me on buying an EV for the short term. Too little car for too much money. I decided I'd go in a different direction for a replacement daily driver (*way* different direction; I got a CPO BMW M4) and revisit the EV market in a few years when there should be several more options to give better choices as well as keep the prices from getting stupid. 

The Model 3 or any other Tesla I'm just not interested in. Too many common QA issues, too sparse of a service network, and I just don't have enough faith in the company."
33706,"Fair enough, a lot of folks have complaints with Tesla service. I've never had to work with them as my 3 has had no issues (though it's only 7 months old and has 9k miles, it better not have had issues). 

The Bolt is likely what I'm going to try to get my parents into when their C-Max Energi lease is up. I love the Niro EV far more than the Kona, but Asian cars are instant nos from them."
33707,"I looked pretty hard at the Niro EV too and if Hyundai hadn't soured things it was a real contender. From everything I looked at they were damn near the same vehicle but with a different battery supplier, a longer wheelbase on the Niro, and like 2 or 3 options differences. The lifetime warranty that Hyundai gives you on the Kona is a big selling point too though. The discounts that Bolts are apparently starting to see is what I'm hoping to see more of in another few years. Since they're no longer the only mainstream long-range EV in that price range they need to work harder to make sales. Though the phasing out of the rebates might hurt that..."
33708,"Yeah the Bolt is going for a bit of a discount around here now, first time since launch. That's making me optimistic that we can get one for my folks' next car affordably. 

I hope the Niro and Kona EVs are huge successes, same with the new Soul EV."
33709,"I absolutely love mine. I almost never charge at public chargers, I just plug it into the wall socket at home overnight every few days to keep it topped up. My commute is only 10km on average though. A few days a week I have to drive an extra 50km but on those days I can (and sometimes do) charge at the VW dealer where I work. 

It’s a Golf and feels like a regular Golf. It’s super fun to drive, especially off the line. I haven’t had any issues with it, and haven’t had to buy gas in 7 months."
33710,"Never driven one so I will be going based on theory.

Positives

* Intant torque
* Cheapt to refuel
* Quiet
* No direct polution

Negatives

* Expensive to purchase
* Low range (on cheaper models)
* Battery degradation which reduces the range even more
* Longer refuel times
* Limited body style choises(Hatchbacks,Saloons and SUVs)
* Less places to recharge the car
* Most of them are ugly(Subjective opinion)

Overall eletric vehicles aren't at that point where I would be considering buying one.

EDIT:Not related to the subject at hand, but damn OP isn't really doing well in his life after i clicked on his profile and saw that post he made. I don't trully know what to say about that, but I hope life gets better for you."

33715,"i'd probably be the worst candidate to get an e-vehicle just because i'm the kind of guy who forgets to charge his phone and is running on less than 20% for half the day. Charging tech would really have to advance to the point where it's faster to plug-in & juice up than to refill the tank at a standard gas station to be viable in my mind. I guess i'm a creature of habit and really hate adjusting my lifestyle and routine to new tech. I want gadgets to work & conform to my schedule, not the other way around."
33716,"Do you park in the same place overnight? Get out, plug in, go on with your day. There's nothing to forget, honestly and I'm a forgetful person. I've never once forgotten to charge my EV. Plus, if the range is longer than you need the next day, you're fine to forget on occasion and just swing by the DC Fast Charge station if you need it."
33717,"Off-road electrics are great, as you can make them completely water proof and they have instant torque, think about it, but I don’t like the idea of an American sports car having one just for nostalgia, but other countries cars can be electric, and our non sports cars and I will be fine"
33718,"I have no place to charge it, and likely won't have for the next 20 years seeing how the housing market here has been on the brink of collapsing for years already.

I do like EV's, instant torque is fun and saving on gas is DEFINITELY fun when your gas is nearly $8/gallon.

I think I'll go hybrid before I go EV though, since a hybrid can at least survive on gas if the charging lot at work is full."
33719,"I like them. The driving experience is very unique and addicting. A Model 3 is high on the list for my next daily driver.

That said, I still prefer the experience of gas cars."
33720,"I'm a huge fan of them - I bought my Model 3 because I test drove one and fell in love. Having lived with it for 7 months now, I don't really see the point of buying a new gas car and dealing with the inconveniences of gas, assuming you have a reasonable commute and a dedicated parking spot at home to charge. If you're generic suburban homeowner, they're perfect right now IMO, which is the boat I fall into."
33721,"They don’t fit my use profile yet, and won’t for awhile. 2-4 hour commute then park the car in a lot for 2-7 days, then drive the car back. Live in apartments and will continue to do so for awhile so limited charge access. Leaving the car to charge probably won’t go over well either.

A PHEV would definitely work better, but I’m likely going to just buy a conventional car.

Nothing against them, and I certainly wouldn’t mind it in a two car household."
33722,"I drive a Model 3 Performance. I see a lot of people in this thread saying EVs will be great for commuting, and that's true - however I hope all of these people try a Performance 3 because it is astonishing. It's a fighter jet for the street. The acceleration is insane, it actually rotates in the corners, and track mode is brilliant at using the cars' dual motors and regenerative braking to torque vector and throw weight around in ways that improve handling. Autopilot and no gas is just a bonus. 

I'm not saying EVs are the future of Performance, because I believe gas cars will eventually be the new vinyl records. We collect them, we play with them on Sunday mornings and we appreciate them for their Fidelity. But EVs are quickly becoming part of the Performance conversation. The Model 3 is the first EV that can thrash all day at the track and not overheat - an important step for EVs. 

As charge times continue to improve and costs come down, it's going to be really hard for enthusiasts to ignore the benefits of an EV as a vehicle that can do it all - commute economically and also put up blistering times at the track.

I expect the Taycan and electric Cayman will go a long way to convincing folks in this sub. Those are due in 2020 and 2022 respectively."
33723,"The moment an electric sportscar is made that doesn't weigh a crap ton, I'll buy one. That's very hard to do though, other than the original Tesla Roadster, and those are hard to find nowadays. If there was a way to make a manual electric car, that'd also be really neat, but it wouldn't really make much sense from a design standpoint to do so.

&#x200B;

They're objectively better daily drivers (provided infrastructure in your area allows for it) than ICE's are. I'm no Tesla shill, but I've driven the Model 3 and it is a genuinely good car. Comfy, spacious, techy, and a mountain of torque whenever you want it. I'd still rather own my WRX though. (For now, at least ;\])"
33724,"Rode in a friend's Model 3 recently.  Hate the styling and the tacked on tablet dash design, but the tech parts are where we're headed IMO. Loved the torque/performance and self driving stuff.

I don't know if electric will get replace things like delivery vans or pickups used to haul, but I don't think we're too far away from an electric fitting the bill for your average suburban family SUV buyer, especially in cases of a multi-car household where the other vehicle is still ICE or hybrid.  Cost and the required behavioral change is the biggest hurdle there. 

To get to further adoption than that, we're going to have to do a lot of work on charging speed and range for consumer models.  I don't see people who only own one car or do a lot of traveling in rural areas replacing an ICE unless they can get a quick 'fill up' on basically any corner.  That's an infrastructure/battery question rather than just EVs though."
33725,">I don't know if electric will get replace things like delivery vans or pickups used to haul

I think those will probably be the fastest to electrify once options are available in those segments. There's zero reason USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL are not using BEVs today since they have known, fixed routes and known, fixed overnight parking places on company-owned property where chargers can be installed. 

There aren't enough EV vans on the market yet, there's no EV Sprinter or Transit that they can buy if they wanted to."
33726,">I don't know if electric will get replace things like delivery vans or pickups used to haul

UPS is already testing vans and trucks in LA."
33727,I think we are just in the infancy stage and we are going to look back at electric cars right now the way we look at people from the 90s who carried those massive brick cell phones.
33728,"That's what gas vehicles seem like to me already. Eventually EVs will be obsolete, but we've got a long way to go before then."
33729,"I'm gonna be honest, I live in a cold ass place and electric cars are proven not to last long here because the battery tech is not at its peak yet. I'm not a fan and I really perform gas cars still. However I really like the concept of hydrogen vehicles and I test drove a Toyota Mirai and I can honestly see myself owning one at some point once they're released up here. It didn't have the feel of an electric car it felt like an every day gas car and i was very impressed. I hope the technology takes off"
33730,"> It didn't have the feel of an electric car it felt like an every day gas car and i was very impressed. 

The Mirai is basically an electric car but without a large battery. It should drive like most EVs."
33731,Not true. Mine worked better at -28F than our Outback here in MN and it's heat not cold that kills batteries long-term. Even then you're pretty much only talking about the gen 1 Nissan Leaf. Cars with thermal management systems like Teslas have been proven to last many years and many hundreds of thousands of miles only losing up to 5% of original capacity.
33732,"My Model 3 has been the best winter car I've ever driven, there's never a concern about ""will it crank"" there's no warmup time needed, it's an incredible cold weather (-20F) car. 

Hydrogen is DOA. There's too much energy loss taking electricity, making hydrogen, storing it, then turning it back into electricity before using it to move the car, when you could just take electricity and move the car.

The biggest disadvantage of hydrogen by far though is that you don't have a hydrogen fueling station in every building, but every building (in the developed world, anyway) has electricity. Therefore any parking spot is already a charging spot, with enough planning. Often with no more work than an extension cord."
33733,"As it stand right now I wouldn't want an EV. Range can still be an issue, as is charging the cars. I live in the countryside, my town has a grand total of three chargers. None of these are of the high speed kind so getting a full charge will take some patience. Even with superchargers like Tesla you still have to be willing to wait some time, at the risk of your batterylife. 

There is also the issue of how long the battery will last. In the end an EV has the same battery as your phone or laptop. While it will last longer, it will start to degrade. Can an EV live to be 15 years old without needing new batteries? 

If I had to chose I'd think hybrids are better for now. PHEV's just seem like a clunky in between stage."
33735,The 8 year warranty is nice when you buy it new. But cars usually last longer then 8 years. The future health of the battery will be a major factor for the second hand market.
33736,"Well, at this point, the price for a replacement battery is around 8k, which is likely to drop after 8 years.  I'm not sure how that compares to a transmission or engine or whatever, but, that's whenever it would need to be replaced after 8k IF there's a fault.  But the data thus far shows that the degradation is not going to be a big deal even after that long."
33737,"Do you have electricity at home? Then the number of charger in your town is not necessarily a concern. I charge my EV from a wall outlet on my house, with no issues. And you also don't need a ""full charge"" you only need enough for the drive you're about to do. If I need to run a 20 mile errand and I'm at 180/264 charge, I don't wait for 264 to go.

Battery life is a non-issue for most people. Model S and X vehicles are getting over 200k from their packs. 

Unlike a cell phone or laptop, car batteries have significant reserves - you don't charge to 0 and 100%, you charge to like 10 and 90% which keeps the battery healthier longer."
33738,"Love em, but they aren't quite where they need to be for me to justify one:

- Heavy batteries kill handling
- Price is still high for me
- Variety and options are lacking
- Everything is proprietary and requires an electrical engineering degree to troubleshoot/fix problems.
- Batteries have a shelf-life and are extremely expensive to replace."
33739,"I don’t feel bad handling in RWD Model 3, it is very different than Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf."
33740,"I drove a P100D. It was a riot in a straight line but felt like a Toyota Camry in the corners.  Not terrible, but not exactly a track weapon either."
33741,A P100D has half the handling capability of a P3D.
33742,"P100D is larger and heavier than a P3D, they're different beasts."
33743,"They're cool. Different driving experience, but don't seem like they're ready yet (if they'll ever be) to replace internal combustion outright."
33744,"The only real reason I don't care for them now is their limited range and power and the fact it takes a long time to charge them.  Plus I have this somewhat unfounded bias of battery powered devices not being consistent in power as the battery gets drained.  

With a gasoline car, power is ALWAYS there as long as you have the quantity of gas to power the engine in that moment and that aids in long range drving.  With batteries, it's more of a curve, technology depending, and performance constantly degrades ( most certainly at a rate faster than ICE).  That and in a gas car, the electricity usage doesn't as directly consume your fuel storage.  

Also they're currently expensive, have undetermined long term reliability, and currently, can't replace petrol for fun.  No exhaust note, no sound of combustion and ignition, etc.  

But there's no denying that in the long run they're probably 100% better for the environment.  I'd like one as a beater.  But not as my primary machine."
33745,"Too damn expensive, and nowhere to recharge them where I live.


Personal issues: they are boring. Add a fake clutch pedal and a fake manual stick, add limiters to the electrical engine to make it behave depending on how I'm operating the stick and clutch (to mirror actual manual car driving behaviour), and make it make artifical engine sounds in speakers depending on the clutch and stick. And I'm in lol. Driving a stick is like 50% of the fun from car driving for me, I'm addicted to shifting.

And they're too complicated, I like my cars as simple as possible. Engine, AC, oldschool gauges, and go. Don't need any fancy AWD or infotaintment systems/reverse cameras."
33746,"You're describing complicated. Clutches, shifters, etc. *are* complicated.   


Teslas don't even have ignitions. It's all about a streamlined, simple experience."
33747,A clutch and a shifter is something entirely different than a infotainment system and a parking camera. Don't you think?
33748,"I have no problem with them, I just hope that performance ICE's are still developed even on an average manufacturer level. I'm more against autonomous cars because I actually enjoy driving. But I can absolutely see the appeal of autonomous work commutes because who really likes driving in rush hour traffic"
33749,I'm pretry neutral on them. I just don't agree with the predictions of them taking over the roads. They have their ups and downs just like all other power sources for cars.
33750,They will have to force me to get one.
33751,"I like them, I don't think theres any out now that I would buy personally, but I like them.  There's just a lot of new tech so you either get an affordable car with a fisher-price interior and muted driving experience or an expensive car with a fisher-price interior and fantastic driving experience or and even more expensive car with decent interior and fantastic driving experience."
33752,Once the range improves on them and there is a wider variety of choices I'll probably get one. Right now they're a bit too expensive and limited range-wise for me to consider one in the near future.
33753,"I'd prefer a phev with about 30 miles of electric only range and at least 300hp personally. EV range is impacted too much by driving style and ambient temperature conditions for my liking even after batteries improve a good bit (probably decades from now honestly). 

I saw a blacked out Merc S 560e in Athens last month, thing was silent and pretty sweet."
33754,"I like them. I kind of think people who dislike or hate them are dumb I guess. I can understand why people don’t want them (limited options, Costs , range ), but It beats me how people prefer something that’s pretty much destroying our future instead of something that’s environmentally responsible and conscious."
33755,"Hopefully one will become available that has the looks I like, the features I want and at an acceptable price point."
33756,"I live in southern Ontario, right across the border from Detroit. Friends, family and the cottage are north and north east of Toronto, roughly 700km away. There also aren't that many ev chargers the further north you go.

Do I like them? Yeah they're pretty cool.
Are the feasible in my situation? Not really.

If anything I'd need a second vehicle for longer trips up north, or even a hybrid over a full ev.

My dad came by with a rental Ford fusion Hybrid the other day. It was pretty slick and with an electric range of 80km would be perfect for the daily commute/ puttsing around town, and when it switches to gas would be best for the road trips. One day when charging/range is better, or I can afford the luxury of a second car, I'd go full ev. Until then, it wouldn't work."
33757,"Unless range gets higher or fast charging stations proliferate, can’t consider one."
33758,I think range is pretty good nowadays. I agree about the lack of charging stations.
33759,"I've put on nearly 15k miles since picking mine up in Dec and have only visited fast charging stations a handfull of times. Every morning I'm charged up from my garage.

That's the big sleeper of a benefit most people don't really appreciate until they get one. I used to stop 2-3x a week for gas due to my long commute. I don't do that anymore.

Sure, people live in apartments and many others don't yet have the ability to get charging at home but that's already changing. Comparing fast-charging stations to gas stations is only a small sliver of the whole story. If everybody with a garage were already capable of filling up their gas cars at home at about $0.80/gallon then you'd have a lot more similar comparison."
33760,Good point!
33761,I can't see them being as fun as combustion vehicles. They're cool and I think the sector should grow but the day electric/hybrid take over the market I'll be sad.
33762,"I'm sad they haven't already taken over - they're so much more fun with the instant power. I have a Mustang and a Model 3 and it is so hard to choose the Mustang over the silent Model 3. I've put 7,000 miles on the Model 3 since I bought it, and 125 miles on the Mustang in the same time."
33763,For me it's not about power. It's about the sound of the engine as it races to the red line. The light shaking of the car at idle and the increases in gs as the turbos kick in. There's so much more going on than just acceleration which is why you see so many people rave about slower cars like the miata and s2000.
33764,"For me it's about handling feel and performance, but refinement is key at any price point. Shaking, vibration, noise those are all unacceptable. BEVs provide the best of both worlds for me, none of the unpleasant noise, vibration, smells, but all of the power and sporty handling."
33765,It seems odd to get a mustang whilst not liking noise and vibration. EVs definitely seem right up your alley. But silence and just power is too boring for me. Speed just isn't enough to make a ride interesting for me.
33766,"That's why I got the 2.3L Performance Pack - less noise, less vibration (and active noise cancellation!) but with all the handling bits."
33767,"They're the future, they're awesome, and they aren't going to kill the enthusiast industry.

Now with that said, I'm going to be busy enjoying vintage gas motoring while I can."
33768,"Enthusiasts can drive EVs too, you know. So no, EVs won't kill the enthusiast industry."
33769,"I want to see more range-extender options.  Commute-range battery + range extender for road trips.  Something like GM's Voltec is ideal.

I could charge at work and at various public charging stations but cannot charge at home, and I take too many long trips to deal with charging on the road, so BEVs are a non-starter for me."
33770,"PHEVs and Range Extenders are the worst of both worlds. You end up with a terrible EV and a terrible gas car.

33771,"A BEV is a non-starter for me, so a PHEV or EREV would be the best choice for me.  I'm not alone in this either.

Additionally, they will help solve the ""chicken or egg"" scenario with BEVs and chargers.  People don't want to buy BEVs without good charging infrastructure.  People don't want to build charging infrastructure without BEVs.

Glad BEVs work for you, but they aren't a solution for everyone."
33772,"For limited use cases (on street parking) I can see where PHEVs have advantages over BEVs. But I've had a PHEV and it sucked compared to a BEV in basically every way. Even road trips in the BEV are more enjoyable than the PHEV.

Infrastructure won't get built for PHEVs. PHEVs don't make business sense to put DC Fast Charge capability into, so they can't use the chargers that are most needed for BEV adoption. PHEVs do not help the BEV road trip infrastructure, period. 

They may help convince more workplaces, apartments, malls, etc. to put in Level 2 AC charging, but that's not where the BEV infrastructure gap is."
33773,"In 20 years, there will not be a single luxury car that is not electric."
33774,"For a dedicated-daily they sound absolutely perfect; peak torque at a dead stop, nearly-silent, no shifting... they're just so darned simple to operate, and their silence really helps them ""fade into the background"" as you drive. In a daily, I think that's ideal.

33775,"Have you driven an EV? I love the instant response of EVs, the ability to do one-pedal driving on twisty, challenging roads without even lifting your foot off the accelerator is sublime. The Model 3 is the best corner carver I've ever driven because it lacks the drama of the engine, the shifting, the braking. You're one with the machine, steering, accelerating, focusing. Not getting distracted by noise and vibration."
33776,"I have, and while I very much enjoyed the experience and all, it just didn't ""grip"" me as much, emotionally-speaking; it felt smoother and more luxurious than a comparable ICE car becaus of the drivetrain (quieter and smoother), but that's kinda the problem for me; the car needs to be at least a *little* raw and mechanical, and the EV drivetrain made the car feel like an electric go-kart, kinda video-game like, which made me feel a bit... ""removed"" from the driving experience. 

The power delivery was instant and predictable (1 gear ratio
 and all that), but in spite of the objective boon of the electric performance it just... I dunno; for the purpose of fun, there's something (to me) about the rising and falling noise of the engine and the satisfaction of a perfect shift."

Currently, Tesla easily makes the best EV's, and they too are disappointing. The interiors are the biggest miss for me,  both in design and in quality; in the end I feel like you pay luxury car prices and receive a high end Nissan interior at best.

The range and charging limitations, though getting better, are still a big issue for those of us that don't live on the east coast. 

&#x200B;

The performance is getting there, but they are all one trick ponies: They accelerate really well to 60mph, they all still have overheating issues (though the new 3 is better than the S), I don't like the numb steering, or the brakes, and you can absolutely feel the enormous weight of the battery. 

&#x200B;

Right now, I just can't justify the price premium you pay for an EV, so until the range goes up, there are more charging locations, the charging time comes down, and an EV is the same price as equally equipped ICE car, I will not buy an EV."
33781,"> The performance is getting there, but they are all one trick ponies: They accelerate really well to 60mph, 

The 3 is ceratinly not a one trick pony. People have been very successful with them on track."
33782,"Define “success” for track

In the R&T test, the P3D pulled huge amount of power after a few laps in cool weather conditions.

It’s more of a fast commuter car, not good for track days. No camber adjustment, skinny tires, undefeatable nannies, heavy understeer bias, inadequate cooling for long term durability, not that fast after a few laps, charging is impossible or inconvenient.

They are amazing for autocross though. Usually there’s a sharp turn right after starting line. The P3D just accelerates through it like it is on rails. Perfect “gearing” and great visibility for cones."
33783,"By successful, I mean people have been able to post pretty respectable times. I'm not trying to say that they're great track cars. I just think it's unfair to call them ""one trick ponies"" that only accelerate to 60mph well. Especially when you consider their results.


That said, many of the problems you listed have pretty simple solutions. MPP sells camber bolts, tires can be upgraded,and Track mode tones down most nannies and makes the car less prone to understeer while also improving cooling and lap times."
33784,"Modifications can address issues. But in the greater pictures with all those issues, imo it is more of a one trick pony for drag racing in Mountain View. One issue I missed is the standard 4 piston Brembo in the front. Those will definitely need to be upgraded. It also loses 10-20% torque between 15-60% charge.

Software is not going to help the inadequate cooling, when it is already beyond the limits with cooling system running at 100% in track mode. The problem is that there is no way to address this. It's a closed system that is integrated with their software. 2-3 seconds on a 1.5 mile track in cool weather brings the performance closer to a $35k hot hatch (assuming 100% charge). Include the torque vs. charge issue, and it will maybe get passed by similar skill drivers in BRZ by end of session."
33785,"It is ok, certainly nothing special.

They still overheat on the track, though nowhere near as bad as the S, they still can only run full hot laps on very short tracks; which is ok. The 3 is not a sports sedan, it is a mid-grade commuter / family car with some really good acceleration for it's class (Accord, Camry, Maxima, etc.), it is just really expensive for it's class."

Being quicker around streets than a Giulia QV is certainly more than Ok. 

>They still overheat on the track, though nowhere near as bad as the S, they still can only run full hot laps on very short tracks; which is ok

3s don't overheat in the same sense that the Model S did. They just slowly pull back power. People are doing 10-15 laps without entering ""reduced power mode"" like the Model S did. 


>The 3 is not a sports sedan, it is a mid-grade commuter / family car with some really good acceleration for it's class (Accord, Camry, Maxima, etc.), it is just really expensive for it's class.

The 3 isn't in that class. It's directly aimed (sized and priced) to compete with the 3-series, C-Class, A4, Q50, and IS. Also, really tough to not consider it a sports sedan when it's beating its competition both on the drag strip and on the track. 

Besides, It has really good acceleration for any class. The P3D out-accelerates the M3, ATS-V, Giulia QV, and C63."
33787,"Pretty sure the P3D that went faster around the Streets was modified with wider tires and upgraded brakes?

The 3 is absolutely in that class, it may be as expensive as the true Luxury cars, but it isn't one. It simply does not have the interior to fit in that segment; I am not saying it has a terrible interior, it is about on par with a high end Accord/Camry which is pretty nice, but not at all on the Luxury car level in both materials and fit and finish.

Maybe next generation they can bring the cost down and quality up."
33788,"> Pretty sure the P3D that went faster around the Streets was modified with wider tires and upgraded brakes?

IIRC they were the same size, just a cup2 rather than a PS4S and upgraded pads. The stock car went a 1:23.90. About as quick as an M4 and quicker than a GT PP1.  Also, remember that the Alfa comes with ridiculous tires from the factory. 


Either way, pulling that kind of time with just tires and pads is certainly not ""just ok"". Especially when you consider it's doing all this for $60k.

>The 3 is absolutely in that class, it may be as expensive as the true Luxury cars, but it isn't one, it simply does not have the interior to fit in that segment.

I don't really agree with that. It's not on the level of the A4, G30, or C-Class. But It's definitely as good if not better than the IS and Q50. It's was also on par with the F30. 

I don't think having worse interior quality is a solid argument for classifying the car in an entirely different category. If you set aside the interior, the 3 is priced like the Germans, it's a similar size to the Germans, it's RWD or AWD like the Germans, and performs like the Germans. You have to ignore all of those factors in order to put it amongst a bunch of FWD econoboxes.

It also seems that you've changed your tune. [""This is an 80k performance sedan, not a 15k family car""](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/94bgnk/tesla_model_3_performance_track_test/e3jvko7/)"

33792,"We're on our third one, so I guess we like them. I've sold two of our four ICE cars and I'm almost to the point of selling the other two. It's been nice having the MR2 for sporty driving, and the Highlander for road trips because they filled niches the Leaf and Bolt couldn't. Maybe I'll keep the Highlander for hauling messy shit, IDK. The Tesla was expensive but it's the first EV where I don't feel like we've had to make any more compromises. I feel like I'm almost at that point I was where I saw the LCD and plasma TV's coming and I yard-saled all our CRT televisions for decent money before you couldn't give them away.

I don't miss the ICE sounds. I don't miss the maintenance. I don't miss transmissions and laggy acceleration. I don't miss standing around freezing my ass off in the cold at gas pumps in the winter. I don't miss 20% daily price fluctuations in my fuel costs. I don't miss the part where the wife insists we sit in a line of cars at the fuel pumps at Costco for 20 minutes so we can save $0.10 a gallon. I don't miss those fucking TV's they have on gas pumps at so many places nowadays screaming ads you can't turn off no matter how many buttons you push. Really the whole paradigm.

I still have to tolerate all that shit with my company car, but when it comes to weekend driving we've pretty much exclusively used the EV's for years now.

I'd probably buy one of those Honda Urban EV's like OP."
34067,"Alright, let's start with the games I haven't played and my estimations of where they'd likely rank if I had. For context, I got into the Pokemon craze near the end of Gen 4 and beginning of Gen 5 and while Explorers of Time was my first ever Pokemon game, Black and White was my first main series game, so bear in mind I have a biased opinion:

I haven't played Yellow and it would basically be the same as Red and Blue with slightly more colour anyway, so only slightly higher.

I skipped LGPE, the idea of only Gen 1 Pokemon doesn't appeal to me, this would probably be near the bottom

I haven't played Crystal, it would probably be only slightly higher than Gold and Silver if I had.

I haven't played Diamond & Pearl, but it would likely be in the bottom half due to being incredibly dated

1. Platinum - When I was a kid, I asked my Dad if he could bring me a copy of Pokemon Diamond, (I was little and really liked it's role in PMD) and was surprised, but not upset when he brought home a pre-owned copy of Pokemon Platinum. Little did I know, that this game was to become my favourite game in the series. I've replayed it 3 times now with all starters, one of which was a Nuzlocke, so maybe repeated experiences are playing a part in it, but I loved how difficult this game was and I felt really proud when I earned victories against the Gym Leaders. The Sinnoh Battle Frontier is also excellent and I loved that Gen 4 gave new evolutions to Pokemon who desperately needed them. If Game Freak decide to make Gen 4 remakes, I only hope that I have is for them to be based on Platinum. I also loved the explorations of mazes in Mt Coronet and Stark Tower. Overall, not much else I can say.
2. Black 2 & White 2 - The content in these games were phenomenal, I remember gleefully spending hours in the PWT, Pokestar Studios and catching Legendary Pokemon just doing my own thing. There was a perfect balance between story and adventure and while yes, the story wasn't quite as good as it's prequels, it was still amazing. The only problem I had with these games was the implementation of the Key System. Seriously, why did you have to beat the game before you could unlock a higher difficulty? It didn't make sense. Other than that, they were amazing.
3. Black & White - I believe I echo the sentiments of many when I say that this game was the best in the series in terms of story, Team Plasma were great villains and they had the best characters in the series in terms of moral ideologies. Admittedly, the difficulty didn't really register to me since I used an overleveled Victini at the time (Hey, cut me a break I was a 9 Year old kid at the time) and when I replayed, I simply used my smarts and strategy to overwhelm enemies, but this was still a difficult game and I still miss the rivalry I had with my friends over whether Serperior or Samurott was better (Trust me, there were massive fights in the playground.) While I do have some minor gripes with the game (The postgame is lacking in comparison to other titles.) The story and creative Pokemon designs more than make up for it.
4. HeartGold & SoulSilver - These games are great, they added following Pokemon which should be in more games, have a wide and all encompassing postgame and lovingly updated the Gen 2 games to their Gen 4 model, but as you'll see, I'm not a fan of Gen 2 to begin with and it frustrates me to see that these games retain many of their flaws; the story isn't great, Johto is infested with Kanto Pokemon, the level curve is atrocious (Which really annoyed me from a Nuzlocking perspective) and it seems like no one would remember these games if not for travelling to Kanto. They're still excellent games to me and I enjoyed playing through them, but in my opinion, they're a tad overrated by the fans.
5. FireRed & LeafGreen - I felt a legitimate connection to my Pokemon in these games (Mainly because it was my first Nuzlocke, but moving on) and the story was well done in it's simplicity. I also enjoyed the addition of the Sevii Islands, but admittedly, this game probably wouldn't be as high if it hadn't been the site of my first Nuzlocke. Still, for what it's worth, if you want a Kanto playthrough, I'd suggest no better than these games.
6. Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon - I just find these games fun, maybe it's because I've played them too much, but I just had a good time with my team in this region. I will admit that most of the negative points of Sun & Moon still stand, namely the long cutscenes and handholding making the game unreplayable, but I played through with one of my favourite teams in any of my games so that might be a reason that I liked it regardless. Also, Team Rainbow Rocket and Ultra Necrozma were awesome. I also enjoy the Battle Tree and Ultra Wormholes.
7. Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire - I really liked Hoenn as a region from the few times I played it before and I remember jumping for joy when remakes were finally announced. I really liked the story additions they made for Wally, Rayquaza and Zinnia as well as the new designs for Archie and Maxie. It was also the first time I played through a game with my now favourite starter Sceptile, so that's probably another reason why I look back on it so fondly.
8. Emerald: I feel like this game would be higher on the list if I played it more (Hey, maybe I should do a Nuzlocke of this). The introduction of the Battle Frontier and Steven as a miniboss sound like great post-game content, but given how I haven't experienced those things and only played through this game as a solo-Sceptile run, I don't feel comfortable ranking it any higher. Other than that, Rayquaza's cutscene was great and I loved the difficulty spike they were from Ruby and Sapphire. (Looking at you Tate and Liza)
9. Sun & Moon - I think these games have a better story than their successors in terms of Lillie, but I don't have as much personal experience and investment with them as I do with USUM and they don't have as much content so they rank lower. Other than that, all my problems with Gen 7 still stand.
10. Ruby & Sapphire - I admit I have limited experiences with these games, they seem fine, but Emerald and ORAS fix many of the issues I have with them. (Emerald ups the difficulty, ORAS has a more interesting story, both have better postgames.) As I said before though, Hoenn has too much water. These are middle of the road games for me. I also agree that Hoenn's regional Dex and Pokemon designs are 
11. X & Y - These games aren't that bad in my opinion, but between the dumbing down of boss battles, excessive Gen 1 pandering and unremarkable story, I can see why people dislike these games so much. However, it also introduced some of the best designs in the series despite there being less Pokemon and the almighty power of Mega Evolution, which I found to be an interesting concept. This is another middle of the road game for me, but is lower than RS because of how poorly Mega Evolution was handled. (looking at you, Mega Mewtwo X and Y)
12. Red & Blue - I admit, these games may be a glitchy mess, but that's part of what makes them so entertaining, watching Jrose11's videos and finding out just how bad the AI is is hilarious and interesting and while I do agree for the most part that these games haven't aged well, I still have fond memories of playing Pokemon Blue on my Dad's old Gameboy, then Red on the virtual console. Also, like I said before, the story is done well for how simple it is. The problems I have with it are obvious; the AI is bad, grinding's atrocious, there are as many meh Pokemon as there are good ones and there's nothing to do after catching Mewtwo.
13. Sword & Shield - Keep in mind I've only played through the main campaign but these were the only games I felt guilty for enjoying. The story was the worst in the series apart from the Gym Battles and while Raid Battles were fun for a time, I didn't like the commercialised nature Pokemon was going in, which really turned me off wanting to spend my time and money on the Isle of Armour and Crown Tundra. Adding to this, the Pokemon designs weren't super well done in my opinion with a few exceptions and the Pro-National Dex protestors made me feel guilty for not boycotting the game.
14. Gold & Silver - I honestly don't like these games, they embody all of the problems I have with HGSS, but with next to none of their redeeming qualities. To add to this, they're just too easy, I might have had trouble with Whitney's Miltank before, but with my experience on the virtual console I was able to beat it easily. The AI in general in these games isn't great and most of the Johto Pokemon are forgettable, not being helped by the fact that again, Johto is infested with Kanto Pokemon. Gen 2 is in a weird spot overall when it comes to Pokemon I think; It lacks the buggy entertainment factor that Gen 1 provided, but isn't advanced enough to compare to Gen 3's innovation when it came to Abilities. Seriously, just play HGSS."

34070,X&Y game was terrible. But I like the anime series
33797,"Least favourite are Black and White, and Moon and Sun. The characters are boring (i didn't loved a particular character, like, for example Silver, Lance, Steven), and the most of the nice 6th/7th gen Pokemons are available at late game, i don't enjoy using my fav pokemons just for beating Pokemon League (i'm not a huge fan of battle front or online, in general).

(I havent play 8th gen games) 

My favourites Pokemon games are
1. Platinum: 
I liked: The Sinnoh mythology, Characters (ie Cynthia, definitely my fav Pokemon Champ), soundtrack, variety of pokemons (even if its actually a generation that lacks from variety in types, to he honest). The difficulty curve is accurate and the gym battles are challenging. 
Things that I didnt like: The abuse of HM requirements in some areas (literally i had to fill 2 slots in my team with pokemons with 2 or 3 HMs to complete Victory Road and Mt Coronet), the lack from variety in pokemon types, Team Galaxy (boring), the lack of areas for leveling up before the league... And of course, the fking location of Rock-climbing HM. 

2. Soul Silver: 
-I liked: Characters (Silver, Lance, Claire), references to other (gen 4 and gen 1) games, the available Pokemons at early game (I got Dratini before the 2th badge! Even if it costed me like 2 hours in that fucking card game), Legendaries (Lugia, Raikou), the majesty of the Dragons (the most powerful and wise trainers are asociated with dragons; Lance is really imponent as a dragon trainer), the elite four and champion...and of course, Red (when i first played the game I really didnt expected that)
-didnt like: Its really difficult to catch some Pokemons, the team Rocket its particullary boring in this game, the fucking islands of Lugia, and maybe the difficulty curve before the Pokemon League and Red.

3. Emerald.
It was my first pokemon game. I have good memories but i haven't play it for years, so, i can be objective. Its a personal preference because of nostalgia :)"
33798,"Rse Hoenn was my absolute favorite. It felt like a true game. It was a lot of fun. Loved the Pokémon and it was my favorite map. I loved the desert, the ash area and the sea routes. I miss having complex sea routes to explore. Exploring the ocean floor was so cool. Contests and secret bases were also a lot of fun. Also think it had the best overall story, best puzzles and best set of legendaries. 


I think SwSh were the worst. Played more like a simulator than a game. More expensive plus dlc that should already been in the game. zero story for the first 95% of the game. Climax was a flop. No interesting routes to navigate. They were all really linear. Legendaries were lame. Hated the rival. They cut a lot of my favorites"
33799,"Objectively, gameboy (RBY) games are the worst because they are the slowest running, worst graphically, horribly balanced, offer no post-game besides mewtwo and are filled with bugs and glitches

Objectively, I would HG/SS are the best. They provide the most content: 16 gyms, Red, Multiple bonus legendaries to find, Pokemon following you, rematching gym leaders, battle frontier, etc

Subjectly, Sword and Shield are the worst because the show just how stagnant the series is and how tired gamefreak is of making these games. Barely any post game without DLC (or if you don't care about competitive), the wild area is pretty barren all things consider, super short routes, possibly the worst story in the series, one of the easiest games in the franchise if not the easiest and only beaten out in hand-holding the player by gen 7.

Subjectively, Black and White 2 are the best. I just had the most fun playing white 2 out of any of these games."
33800,I’d argue that diamond and pearl actually play slower then RBY.  And that the bugs are exaggerated since the average player wouldn’t even run into any bugs on a RBY play through.  That said they still are objectively the worse.
33801,"Assuming that we are talking about main line games:

It’s a tie between 3 for my favorite and I don’t have the time to explain the reasoning for each, but it’s between Platinum, Black2/White2, and HeartGold/SoulSilver.

Least favorite is Sword/Shield because it has so much potential, but it was all wasted. The Wild area was fun to explore for the first half hour, but then it lost its charm. Meanwhile every other area in the games is so linear and has zero exploration in it.  Not to mention as a Switch game it has so many problems that other Switch games don’t have (Such as stuff spawning under my feet). Also the story is horrible and there is nowhere new to explore after you beat the main story at all (unless you pay an extra $30)
In short, it’s objectively the worst Pokémon game in my opinion. If I can give one thing to it though, the new Pokémon introduced were pretty good."
33802,i cannot disagree with u good choices
33803,"Best was Gen 5. it really was an amazing Generation. BW1 had the biggest roster, forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story. And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion. 

Worst. From the games I played, definitely the Let‘s Go games. They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on. Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks. 

Though, from the live-streams I watched, SwSh are just embarrassing and low effort products."
33804,"Unovas the best because it has a variety of mons and alot of them have good designs and Kanto is the worst, most of the mons are just boring or terrible at battling. I know people's argument against that is it's the first game in the series but I still hate it"
33805,"unova have some bad designs but i really love PKM black and white 2 the first ones dont give a lot of option but duuuude, the 2 is amazing 10/10"
33806,"Hg/SS are my favorite, has my favorite starter and Pokemon typhlosion. I like the cultural look they gave the buildings and I like how team rocket is trying to rebuild, and the Kanto post game has got to be the best postgame ever

Gen3 is my least favorite and honestly all the water and surfing was too much, it has the least amount of favorable Pokemon out of all the gens, ""I want more water!"" "" I want more land"" idea for the evil team is kind of stupid, I don't like 51/2  out of 8 of the legendaries

I don't count the lets go games otherwise they would be least favorite because I don't like the game play"
33807,"The best for me would be Platinum. People complain about Sinnoh having only played DP. Platinum added a bunch onto DP and none of it was bad. And DP was pretty good as well. Platinum wasn't necessarily the best in any individual aspects, but all around is the best for me and has few issues (just the saving time and the HP bar taking years to go down).

The worst is Sw/Sh. I don't really want to explain why."
33808,"best is xy, i loved everything about them, the region was gorgeous, the new pokemon looked great, i found the story interesting even tho most people don’t and unrelated but it was my favourite season of the anime

my least favourite is sun and moon i just feel like they were a chore to play through and i don’t like the new pokemon, story was pretty good tho but i preferred xy’s story especially the parts about AZ and the war 

honourable mention for the best is dppt just because of nostalgia and platinum being my first game"
33809,i dont really like XY but they have my favorite post game character AKA Emma
33810,"My favourite is BW2, has a wide amount of Pokémon available for use and is fun enough to replay constantly, plus the level curve is designed well enough that you're not notably underleveled at any point and that the challenge comes from the trainers themselves, and not the level gap, and I'd have Emerald and SWSH just behind it on my list.

My least favourite is HGSS (I'll use the remakes as I haven't touched the originals in a long time) due to most of the game being boring, due to a mix of low level Pokémon that end up being the same, mon choice that's more of a pain than anything (half the options are Pokémon I would not want to use) and the level curve being absolutely garbage for pretty much the whole game (overleveled until Clair, and underleveled afterwards with no good places to grind) that the last time I tried playing, I had to stop after Lance."
33811,"Gold and silver for sure. The starter pokemon are the worst in the series, everything is a cakewalk other than the elite four, most of the good new pokemon are found in kanto. I rhink the only pokemin from mainland johto that I like are heracross and ampharos. Other than that yikes. People say the unova dex is bad, at least it has more than 20 pokemkn that weren't bad."
33812,"I'm a fan of Gen 2 and 6... although Gen 6's take on Ruby and Sapphire also bumped it up in my opinion.
I found Johto and Kanto to be packed full of content whereas the move to 3D in X and Y was personally pretty impactful seeing my favourite mons in 3D and getting to feed / play mini games with them. The difficulty could have been ramped up but I had no issues imposing challenges on myself.


Worst gen was Gen 7... don't get me wrong, most of the pokedex is amazing (#TeamRowlet) and the Alolan forms were a genius move. I just found that after the first few Island trials I missed the Gyms. The story was painfully slow. The characters frustrating irritating. And the constant, stop for a cinematic... walk 2 meters.... stop for another cinematic... it's just bad storytelling and gameplay and really made me not enjoy replaying it. US and UM were basically the same... aside from a new Lycanroc, 4 new Ultra Beasts, Mantine Surf (which was pretty cool imo) and the Space Wormhole mini game these two versions were insulting... It's the only  game pair where I didnt by both... one play through was all I needed to put Gen 7 down. Gen 8 barely creeps out of the least favourite category... but I am English so I'm a little biased."
33813,"Imo for the best game it’s a tie between HGSS for the exploration and B2W2 for, well, the game per se (with USUM just a step behind). For the worst I have to say XY, cause it feels... bland. Like, it doesn’t stick out for any reason to me, tho it’s still a good game"

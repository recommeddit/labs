28165,there you find a singaporean!;)
28166,"Double shot espresso w/ cream, granola bar, and a quick prayer that I'm not late for work. Sunday is coffee cake :)"
28167,"my man.

helps that i work at 1pm most days and can take my time with the coffee.

pastry is every day if i have it, most days i don't though (thankfully)"
28168,"On weekdays: Oatmeal with blueberries and walnuts, or toast with peanut butter and banana

On weekends: Eggs over easy, toast or biscuits, assorted cheeses, muesli, yogurt and all the fruit I can find"
28169,"I found the European!

Or maybe not... Peanut butter?"
28170,"We... We do have peanut butter here, you know."
28171,Not in this Europe here.
28172,European checking in. Can't get enough peanut butter.
28173,I'd advise trying Reese's Peanut Butter Cups if you can ever get your hands on them. So much deliciousness!
28174,"Not likely. Oatmeal is the US term for porridge, and 'biscuits' are totally a totally different food over here and not breakfast materials unless you're 12 or having an 'I'm not an adult and I can call in sick and hide in a  pillow fort if I want' kind of day."
28175,Whether or not an European likes peanut butter depends on which country they are from. For example the Dutch love that stuff. And personal taste of course. :)
28176,He's eccentric.
28177,"Nope! 

""eggs over easy"" 

We just call those fried eggs."
28179,"Yes, but one would never hear the term over easy in UK or Ireland."
28181,"""I want eggs over your mum"""
28182,"About 4 months ago I purchased a food processor with a shredding disk. Since then, every time I have the time to make breakfast, I make hash browns from scratch. There's nothing better than fresh hash browns with some red onion, a little cheese, and a side of bacon."
28183,"Try sweet potato hash browns (keep the onion, ditch the cheese, include the bacon instead of having it as a side). Really yummy and surprisingly healthier for you!"
28184,"I'll give it a try, but sweet potatoes have never done it for me. Who knows, maybe this will change that."
28185,"I dislike 'sweet' sweet potatoes usually - like sweet potato pie or casserole. But I like the 'savory' sweet potatoes like hash browns and in stir fry. If, perhaps, you've only ever had them sweet, you might like them savory better. IMO, they're better with salt & fat than they are with sugar :)"
28186,Make corned beef hash!!!
28187,You just gave me my breakfast for this weekend. Thanks!
28188,You betcha
28189,"Biscuits and gravy if I'm making breakfast on the weekend. Or pancakes, but the biscuits and gravy are my favorite. 
Country fried steak if I'm eating out for breakfast."
28190,How long does it take to make your b&g?
28191,How long does it take his b&g to kill a man by slowing down his heart is what I want to know. That's the sign of a good b&g.
28192,"The instant Egg McMuffin with Canadian bacon. 

Take a bowl the size of an English muffin and scramble an egg in it. add salt and pepper. Put a slice of Canadian bacon on top and microwave for a bit. Toast an English muffin at the same time. Flip the egg/Can. bacon over in the dish and microwave to finish. 

Butter the muffin, add a slice of cheese, put the egg/bacon combo in there and stuff your face with it. It only takes a few minutes to make.

NOTE: You can add veggie type granola shit to the egg if that's your thing."
28193,"Bacon, sausage, and eggs sunny side up or scrambled."
28194,The classics never hurt at all.
28195,"I literally can eat it every morning. Sometime with salsa. or with pico de gallo, sometimes both. 

Sometimes, just salt and pepper, other times with maple syrup. They're just delicious in so many ways."
28196,"Its versatile beyond belief.

Take my omelette for example. You can practically throw in whatever you had (within reason) from last night's dinner in there and it will go down fine."
28197,A cup of tea.
28198,GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!
28199,I AM THE QUEEEEEEEN OF FRANCE.
28200,cuppatea
28201,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon- sue me- and since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that."
28202,This is literally the only episode of the office that I laughed hysterically the entire episode.
28203,Check out WeMo (By Belkin). Plug in to that and start your bacon on a schedule or just use your phone!
28205,Chorizo and egg breakfast tacos. If I have time I'll cook up some potatoes as well.
28206,"Honestly? Most mornings I slam half a liter of water, pound a protein shake and snag a piece of banana nut bread on the way out the door.

But on weekends, I'm pretty simple. Oatmeal or raisin bran with some fruit, cranberry juice in spring and summer or a cup of tea in the winter."
28208,"I keep a 4lb bag of chocolate Muscle Milk around for heavy duty days, or days where I have a long drive to start off my work day with. For quick or light days, I keep an 18-pack of Premier Protein (11oz) around. If it's a heavy day, I do 3 scoops, and then 2 scoops that night. For a light day I just need to get by until 10 or so, then I eat some banana nut bread to carb up through lunch and help me rehydrate and avoid cramps. For long drives I replace breakfast and mid-morning snack with a big, diluted 3-scoop serving so I'm not tempted to eat junk and get all sluggish on the way.

The Premier Protein premade shakes are actually delicious if you like Yoohoos. The Muscle Milk not so much, but it's fatty enough that it's a good option if you're actually working hard. I chug them both as fast as possible, but I enjoy chugging Premier a lot more than Muscle Milk.

Protein shakes aren't cheap if you're just supplementing with them and you're pounding them hard and fast. But dollar for dollar, if you're working hard in rough conditions, they make excellent sense. No bubbly gut from gas station food, no super rich breakfast that makes you sick when you work up a sweat, and nothing to weigh you down. Just pure fuel to go with your cigarettes and red bull. Even with Premier premade shakes, you're still getting breakfast for $1.52 at $24.99/18pk with a 9% sales tax."
28209,I love that someone downvoted you for what you ate for breakfast.  Have an upvote.
28210,"Hi Ironman, thanks for doing this. What's your favorite/go-to breakfast meal?"
28211,"I didn't see this when it was down voted, but I'd guess ""pound a protein shake""."
28212,"I know, right? It's almost like I'm supposed to have an artisan-level breakfast every morning before I crawl around and sweat until I puke all that fancy food up.

Nevertheless, I appreciate the upvote(s)!"
28213,">before I crawl around and sweat until I puke all that fancy food up.

What on earth do you do for a living?"
28214,"A little bit of everything, but primarily security and home customization. I'm pretty far south, so imagine crawling in an attic as fast as you can when it's 90F outside (well over 105 in the attic). Want a security system? Got it. Want your doors to lock automatically when it's armed? Done. Want your TV to retract into the ceiling when you turn it off? Done. Want 1080p+ video surveillance? Done."
28215,"Do people like you ever just eat? I mean, I like to slam, pound, and snag as much as the next person. But geez what happened to family time? /joking"
28216,Family time was devoured in the pursuit of sick gainz.
28217,"Totally, brah. After a killer bulk sesh I like to chill with the fam, usually by slamming some dunks on my son, chugging tea at a party with my daughter, and then later I pound my wife."
28218,"4 Scrambled eggs, only 2 yolks, with a little milk and pepper
Whole wheat tortilla heated with a little cheese
Chopped tomato, green onion, jalapeño 
Half an avacado, sliced
Hot sauce
Wrap it all up and breakfast is gone in 10 bites!"
28219,"So, what do you do with the other yolks, and why are you taking them out?

I like the recipe, I just can't see the point in wasting the tastiest bit of two eggs."
28220,A guy I know is a bit of a workout enthusiast and he always threw out the yolks. Turns out he thought all the protein was in the whites and the yolks were just fat. I don't know how prevalent this misconception is but that might have something to do with it.
28221,Gigantic fucking omelet (5 eggs minimum) with cheese & sliced Italian sausage. With a cup of espresso coffee.
28222,So really big egg and really little coffee? sounds legit.
28223,"I said a cup, not a shot."
28224,Vegemite on buttered toast with sharp cheddar and very thinly sliced dill pickle.
28226,Don't let him fool you. The dill pickle has no place in Australia!
28227,"Swear to god, I've been eating this for much longer than it's been popular, but avocado toast.

1/2 avocado

2 slices of wheat bread

two eggs sunny side up or poached


499 calories to boot."
28228,"This is my weekend breakfast, and if I have any some crispy pancetta on top. Lovely glass of cold orange juice and I'm set up for the day."
28229,Avocado toast is god tier breakfast.
28230,"Baked oatmeal cut to six pieces. Each morning put one from fridge to toaster oven, then bring it office."
28231,"Weekdays: I make overnight oats each week in mason jars. Keeps you full and its delish! 

1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup Greek yogurt (any flavor)
1/2 cup almond milk 
Hand full of any berries that I have
Tablespoon of chia seeds 
Tablespoon Vanilla extract 
And shake shake shake!  

Weekends: we go to brunch!"
28232,"I've got a few.  

* Two slices of bacon, cooked in the oven at 400 degress while I shower.  When I'm done, I take the bacon out, drain on paper towels while I cook two eggs in a about a teaspoon of bacon grease. 

Low fat version:

* Spray inside of glass measuring cup with cooking spray. Add 1/2 cup eggwhite, egg beaters, etc.  Nuke one minute while toasting English muffin with fat-free cheese.  Add egg ""patty"", salt & pepper, hot sauce - enjoy."
28233,Oven cooked Bacon masterrace
28234,I read that as *Over* cooked and laughed. I think because I was already worried about the bacon burning with OP being in the shower and all.
28235,Honestly I think I'm a monster. I love my bacon to be almost undercooked. when you have crunchy bacon it loses so much flavor.
28236,"That's how I read it the first time, too.  

I put the bacon in a cold oven, set it to convect bake at 400 degrees.  This gives me 25 minutes total to shower, shave, and get dressed.  That's plenty."
28237,"I do the exact same thing with bacon/eggs...sometime try chopping some vegetables and chucking those in. Finely chopped shallots, mushrooms and spinach is probably my favorite combo so far for this. While you're browning the vegetables for a minute or two in the bacon grease, get some toast going and prep your eggs. I like to take the crispy bacon from the oven and crush it into crumbles, then stir it right into my eggs...then dump that right into the bacon grease with the vegetables once you're satisfied with how far along those have gotten. Stir all of it on medium heat till you've got a great looking scramble, then dump some of the scramble on your toast, ideally with some good cheese. Boom, restaurant-grade breakfast sandwich. Seriously, try this once and you'll be doing it every Sunday morning afterward forever. It's also super easy to scale up or down if you've got more people to feed for whatever reason, 1-2 slices of bacon and 2-3 eggs per person."
28238,"Two eggs fried over easy, three slices of bacon. 

who the hell needs toast"
28239,"My go to lately, when I've got time for more than fruit and coffee, has been fried eggs and grits. Sometimes I like to do what I'm sure is just grit blasphemy and mix a bunch of cheese and meats and garlic and caramelized onions into the grits and eat the eggs over easy along side it, kind of like a weird breakfast scramble. Never instant, grits are amazing."
28240,"During the week- yoghurt and fruit.  On the weekends if we're in the mood for something sweet it's waffles with Greek yoghurt,  fresh berries and maple syrup.  If we're leaning towards savory it's eggs Benny on latkes instead of muffins with homemade hollandaise...  Now I want some breakfast!"
28241,"Breakfast quinoa! I usually cook some quinoa in either coconut or almond milk with brown sugar, then add banana slices and toasted coconut when serving. It's nice because you can make a big batch and then refrigerate it. It keeps me pretty full, too.   

ETA: [This](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/breakfast-quinoa) is the recipe I use!"
28242,"Leftover meat in a bowl, some cooked leftover vege, crack 2 eggs over, salt & pepper and bake in the toaster oven for 10 to 15 minutes minutes. 

Simple yet ""artistic"", not much to wash, and gives you enough time to slot in a few sets of warm ups before breakfast is ready."
28243,"Sliced avocado on toasted whole grain bread, drizzled with olive oil/lime juice and sprinkled with salt/pepper."
28244,"Thick cut back bacon, a **good** sausage or two, two fried eggs, still warm from my chickens, Bury black pud, mushrooms, Heinz beans, which, of course, should be slightly overcooked. Toast. 

Tea. Obviously.

No lunch required."
28245,"I don't eat breakfast most days, but when I do I like to make a cup of minute rice, then once it's done, put it back over the heat and add a teaspoon of butter and let it melt, then crack in two eggs and keep it moving so the egg coats the rice. Just when it's almost dry, I add a bit of cheese and take it off the heat to finish."
28246,"No time: parfait. Granola, yogurt, fruit. Sometimes some honey depending on the fruit, sometimes some nuts depending on the granola. 

Time: grilled cheese with tomato and bacon, grits, eggs, slice of cantaloupe if I have it, OJ. Honestly any combination of meat, eggs, cheese, and toasted bread, with some fruit on the side."
28247,"I work on a fishing boat all summer, just two of us on board. I diced one onion, two potatoes and fried them up with some msg and Lawrys Seasoning. Two eggs on top. We never ate breakfast really unless we were on anchor and didn't have to fish, now I'm cooking that 4 times a week."
28248,"I LOVE a good potato hash. Cubed potatoes cooked until they're soft and creamy, mixed with sautéed onions, garlic, and bacon, and topped with a nice runny egg. Add some coffee and possibly a sauce (maple syrup), it's a filling and delicious breakfast."
28249,"My partner and I don't eat breakfast on weekdays so we usually go all out on weekends. I do have one favorite classic, though.

Salted and peppered sunny side up eggs (I guess? I want the whites totally solid but I like my yolks runny so I turn them to low after they begin to set and put a lid over the pan--what the hell is this called?), sausage and/or slightly soft bacon, buttered toast. I love dunking everything in the yolk. Then I chuck the whites because I'm a big baby and hate them.

I can't describe how much I love this combination. It reminds me of when my gramps used to babysit and I'd wake up to the smell of sausage. It is the loveliest breakfast to me still."
28250,That's definitely sunny side up.
28251,"Egg yolk mixed with Franks Red Hot is heavenly, could eat it every morning (and usually do)."
28252,"Two hard boiled eggs, banana, handful of nuts and coffee. Keeps me full all morning."
28253,"Potatoes O'Brien (cubed potato with chopped onion and green bell pepper) with Mexican-style chorizo sausage and a fried egg on top. And a tall mug of black coffee. I eat breakfast after nearly an hour of strenuous exercise every morning, and that meal has to last me, so I go hearty. 

I start by removing the chorizo from the casing and cooking it in the skillet until it's about 3/4 done and remove it, reserving the oil. It's in that oil I fry up the potatoes O'Brien on high heat until they're crisp on the outside (usually with a bit of salt and pepper). I add the chorizo back in and cook an egg in another skillet, over easy so I can cut into it and the yolk gets everywhere. All told it's probably about 20 minutes of cooking, but it's well worth it. The flavors and textures are just so bold and go really well together. The chorizo has the spice, the savory, and the juice, the potatoes and veggies are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and the yolk just coats everything."
28254,Greek yoghurt with blueberries and müsli.
28255,"Banana, raw almonds and Jasmine tea. This is what I make for myself. When I eat out it is Benedict or pancakes or both if I can play ""Let's Make a Deal"" ordering."
28256,"Laksa or something with eggs & bacon if I can't be bothered.

edit: Goto breakfast is ""weetbix"" or fried eggs on toast."
28257,"Bacon and Egg roll: Two Eggs Sunny Side up, Two slices of thick cut bacon, Soft Bread Roll, Nice spicy relish.

Serve with Banana Thickshake.

Then go back to bed."
28258,"I like sunny side up with toast. :) On a rush day, I'm good with oatmeal with fruit or yogurt with fruit."
28259,"Eggs southwestern over hard. 

Eggs with salt pepper and crushed red pepper cooked over hard, placed on tortillas with cheese and guacamole. Steak if I have any, simply heated up from leftover in a pan with a little butter."
28260,"Weekdays: oatmeal with cinnamon & sugar, raisins, and sliced almonds

Weekends: waffles & bacon, plus anything my SO wants to make if we have the day off together. I'm going to attempt cinnamon rolls soon because I always loved the Pillsbury ones as a kid."
28261,"go to breakfast would be omelet between two pieces of toast

favorite has gotta be cast iron cornbread and bacon"
28262,"I usually go for grits and bacon, but if I'll make biscuits if we've got company. Toast and an over-easy egg if I'm feeling lazy."
28263,"Home made hash browns with some sausage gravy and 2 over easy eggs.

Either that or a sausage, bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin.

I'm probably gonna have a heart attack at age 40."
28264,"3-egg omelet with bacon sauce:

* 3 large eggs, beaten
* 1-2 slices thick-cut bacon, diced
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* ~1 tsp flour
* red pepper flakes and sage to taste

1. Render bacon in small saucepan until mostly crisp; drain most fat and reserve (hint: cook the omelet in it) but leave ~1tsp in pan
2. Toast spices in bacon fat until fragrant, then add flour and whisk to produce a blonde roux
3. Deglaze with chicken stock
4. Cook your omelet while sauce reduces
5. Plate and garnish with parsley"
28265,Corn beef hash with a fried yolky egg on top. The a side of toast with butter and strawberry preserve. Probably one of my favorite meals ever
28266,"Fried eggs on toast, with bacon or sausage and maybe hash browns. Biscuits and gravy. Pancakes. Oatmeal (old fashioned oats 4evah). Waffles with strawberries and whipped cream (in season, which means now!). These are what I'm likely to make any given weekend day. Sometimes I'll do omelettes or benedict or cinnamon rolls but that's rarer. Weekdays we eat cereal (hot or cold, but probably not oatmeal because time), yogurt, bagels, fruits, or fried eggs on toast (no bacon or hash browns because time)."
28267,Skillets... I do potatoes O'Brien (usually frozen kind because convenience) chopped bacon.. Cheese n broil... Then I throw 2 or 3 fried over easy eggs on top n mash it all up. Heavenly goodness!
28268,Wait what's breakfast?
28269,"Weekdays: I scramble 6 eggs with spinach, cook a pound of breakfast sausage, roll them up with cheese in tortillas and freeze them. One of those plus an apple or banana. Or if I've been lazy, a MetRX meal replacement bar.

Weekends: enchilada plate from a local drive-thru Mexican place, then a bottle of Pedialyte and a nap to combat the hangover."
28270,"Over easy eggs,  toast, three pieces of Turkey bacon, and pour over coffee. Been doing it almost every morning for years."
28271,Shakshuka
28272,"My go to is egg-in-the-hole (egg in a basket, blah blah, whatever you call it) because it's stupid fast and delicious. Other than that, if I have more time, it's a frittata in the cast iron. Impressive results, totally a no-brainer to make."
28273,"Eggs (scrambled or over easy), bacon or sausage, and a slice of toast.

Protip, you don't actually need to flip your egg for over easy; just pop a lid on your pan and the top will cook itself."
28274,"Student + work so my breakfast is usually energy drinks.  On weekends when I want breakfast, it's biscuits and spicy sausage gravy with an easy poached egg (egg on top of biscuit smothered in gravy) with a side of hash browns and a frosty cold beer!"

28277,"Diner level greasy over easy eggs. Three of them with a piece of toast. 1/2 -1 tbsp of butter, 3 eggs, then throw some salt, pepper, and my homemade hobanero flakes on them. I have a hard time getting through the day without this breakfast."
28278,"Baguette bread, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, peanut butter and a cup of tea."
28279,"Toast and Chai on weekdays and Banana French Toast on weekends. If I feel like adulting, Iron-fortified cereal with a cup of Milo and some vitamin-C rich fruit"
28280,"Microwave an egg in a coffee cup. Make sure you cover it with a coffee filter or paper towel and don't cook too long or it'll explode all over the inside of your microwave. Toast an English muffin or bagel, put a slice of deli ham or turkey, the egg, a slice of cheddar cheese, some hot sauce or ketchup. Homemade breakfast sandwich in less than 5 minutes."

Also bacon, cup of coffee, hotdog, toast. I need more easy breakfast meals. D:"

If I know I'm having a rough/looong day and I'm in a hurry, a shake consisting of frozen banana, straw/raspberry, oats, milk and cookie-flavored protein powder -> a liter of awesome. Fluffy, nutritious, cold, scrumptious awesome.

28298,Bacon and egg! I know its not that healthy dont judge me!

28303,"I make coffee in a french press, a.k.a a coffee plunger."
28304,"McDonald's egg sausage and cheese English muffin except home made. 

During the week just scrambled eggs and English muffin. 

To be honest I would be very disappointed by most of your breakfasts. I starve at 11 am at work if I don't eat one."
28305,"This time of year I get a bowl of yogurt, cut up a nectarine, crush some walnuts and a piece of rye crisp bread, add flax seeds and cereal until the bowl is full. In the winter I'll have oatmeal and applesauce.

I compliment this with either a peanut butter sandwich, a cheese and marmalade sandwich or crisp bread with cheese and cucumber slices. Always coffee and grapefruit juice.

*shudders*"
28312,"Wow! Yeah, that's happened to me before, not the poopie part. I have consumed coffee while eating chia pudding. Got shakes, nausea. I would do one or the other; not both. Or have coffee an hour or so after pudding."

3. Whatever leftover meat I have laying around: breakfast sausage, bacon, ham, turkey, chicken, etc.

Preparation is just:

1. Heat up the potatoes.

28322,"If I have the time to make them, these days it's usually sweet potato hash browns (shredded sw. pot. & onion, cooked in bacon/coconut oil/both). If I'm feeling indulgent, I then add some eggs & cream and make it into a frying-pan-quiche. Sweet potato w/ egg is surprisingly good."
28323,"I don't eat breakfast normally but on the weekends my favourite brunch is bacon and cheese fritters. Basically I fry some bacon, mix with two grated potatoes, small can of sweet corn, bunch of chives, two eggs, some cheddar and 1/4 cup flour then fry them. I top them with greek yoghurt mixed with garlic and it serves two to three people. Sooo delicious but it's unhealthy so I don't eat it often."

Eggs Benedict is easy as fuck but seems like a lot of work, and Banana pancakes, everyone loves them and if you don't I don't think we can work out.  Sorry, I can get you an uber but you have to wait outside. 

Oh if I have any old French bread and I remember the night before I'll make French toast."
28329,"On the weekends I like to have a Caesar (drink), eggs over easy on a toasted English muffin with tomato and avocado, and some bacon.

28339,"A recent favorite is one I stole from Youtube videos of street food in India. I think it's called ""Disco Eggs"" or ""Bread Omelet,"" but in any case, it's delicious.

At face, it's an omelet made with Indian spices. However, the addition of the bread is a genius stroke.  It's a quick breakfast if all your ingredients are already prepped (I've been leaving tupperware with chopped veggies in my fridge and have most of the spices in shakers I bought at Big Lots).The details are a little personalizable, but I've settled on the following:

## Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup diced Onions (I like red)
* 1/4 cup diced Vegetables (tomatoes, bell pepper for me; peas, carrots, and/or green beans would work well, too)
* 1 Green Chili, diced (or to your preferred spice level)
* 1 tbsp chopped Cilantro/Coriander
* Handful of Frozen Spinach *(Optional)*
* 2-3 Pavs (or any buttery yeast rolls, dinner roll sized; Hawaiian makes a great version; Sara Lee, too)

-----
## Spices (use as you prefer)
* Salt
* Black Pepper
* Chat Masala (a tangy-salty spice mix made with sulfur-infused black salt)
* Garam masala (a spicy-sweet spice mix heavy with cinnamon and cloves)
* Red Chili Powder
* Coriander Powder
* Oil

All of the spices amounts are to taste. Start small and work your way up to your preferred taste (I probably use about 1/2 tsp of Salt, 1/4 tsp of black pepper, chat masala, and garam masala, plus about 1/2 tsp of red chili powder and coriander powder).

In a wide, flat pan, heat oil till it's almost smoking over medium-high heat. Add in your onions and fry, stirring, for about 45-60 seconds. Toss in any tough veggies (e.g., carrots, bell pepper) and your diced green chili. Cook another minute, then add in your ""soft"" veggies (e.g., peas, tomatoes, spinach). Cook a further half-minute.

Crack the eggs into the pan and break the yolks, using a spatula to spread the egg over the vegetables in a rough disc shape. Don't worry too much about scrambling unless you just prefer that.

Sprinkle the omelet with salt, pepper, cilantro, and spices that you like (see above for my suggestions). Then, take your rolls and cut them open. Lay them, cut side down, on the omelet, and using your spatula or a [potato masher](http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Oliver-Stainless-Steel-Masher/dp/B0045EPNBI/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1432739120), lightly press the bread into the omelet, flattening the whole thing out somewhat.

After another minute or so while the eggs set, sprinkle the tops of your rolls with additional spices and drizzle lightly with oil. Using a spatula, flip the whole shebang over (if it's too big, you can always break it into pieces) and use the spatula or masher to press the mixture flat again. Let the bread fry on the pan until a little crispy (about 30-60 seconds more), then serve."

28341,"Not really my go-to, but my favourite is the bacon sandwich. It's just astoundingly good and I love it every single time I eat it. And then a wonderful ritual, I use the grease for a slice of fried bread afterwards. 

Typically I'll only do this once per week, though, since it's terrifically bad for you. 

Other comforts are a soft-boiled egg with toast (soldiers!), porridge in the winter, and with every breakfast, coffee. From time to time I just enjoy a platter of assorted bread products as well (crumpets, teacakes, toast with jam or marmalade &c... but instead of choosing just one like I normally would I have them all and make a small mountain). 

Oh, and when I can get good ones I like croissants for breakfasts. But supermarket ones aren't that great."
28342,I like to take a piece of left over pizza and make an omelet out of it. Just make a omelet like normal and you scrap the toppings as the filling of the omelet.
28343,"Peanut butter + banana toast with a cup of coffee

edit: it is frequently also my lunch and dinner"
28344,"It's not my favorite, but it's a regular at my house. We mix oats, chia seeds, blueberries, dried/unsweetened coconut, milk (or non-dairy alternative and let it sit overnight. In the morning, heat it up with a tablespoon of honey. It's filling, healthy and not boring at all, every day."
28345,Belvita! So awesome
28346,"Lightly toasted, lightly buttered bagel with a scrambled egg, fried sausage and american cheese. Oh my god so good"
28347,"* 1 cup rolled porridge oats
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1 cup water
* 1 small peach per person, chopped into chunks
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* Honey, to serve

Put the oats, milk and water in a saucepan on a low heat. Stir in the cinnamon, and keep stirring until the porridge has reached the desired consistency. Put half the peach chunks into the porridge and stir them in. Serve sprinkled with the rest of the peach chunks and drizzled with some honey. 

A recently discovered breakfast recipe that I've had every morning since. Delicious!"
28348,"Weekdays if I get out of bed right when I wake up and don't sit there having some water thinking about how the hell 5:15 is an actual time that exists, I grab a bowl of cereal with a splash of milk and half a banana. If not I grab a piece of fruit on the way out and eat it at 7:30 when we have a bit of a lull. 

Weekends are for bagels with either some cream cheese or with traditional breakfast sandwich toppings because I live somewhere that has good bagels."
28349,If I have time quiche. Forever quiche. I love quiche.
28350,"With time: Two butter poached eggs sunny side-up, three strips of crispy oven baked bacon, some toasted farm bread, either some fresh tomato (summer) or avacado (winter) and a cup of french press. 

Quick: hard boiled egg with half a grapefruit and some granola or some sliced tomatoes and cottage cheese"
28351,"On weekdays I like to poach an egg in  the microwave or fry it if I have time. I put that in an English muffin with cheese or on top of toast with half a mashed avocado and some Sriracha. On weekdays, I like potatoes hash with a runny egg or a breakfast sandwich with bacon, a runny egg, some cheese and maybe avocado. Or I'll bully my husband into making me waffles, french toast or pancakes.

I really like breakfast, you guys."
28352,"Since your current breakfast looks like a relatively fit meal:

**Oatmeal breakfast pancakes**

1:1 oatmeal:egg whites.

Splash in a little milk and puree the oatmeal/egg mixture in a blender. Add either cinnamon and some sugar or jalapeno and green onions if you want savory. Pour the mix into a nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook just like normal pancakes.

Alternatively, when I'm eating ""dirty"", I'll make breakfast sandwiches with English muffins, sausage, and cheese and then individually wrap them in paper towels and store them in the fridge. Then I can just microwave them the day that I eat them."
28353,I do something similar to the English muffins but make burritos instead. The tortillas heat up pretty well in the microwave and you can use potatoes to bulk it out.
28354,"* Steel-cut oats.  Make them ahead of time and keep them in the fridge, so you just have to reheat them in the morning.

* Alternatively, oatmeal if you don't like steel-cut. So many things you can do/add to oatmeal so it isn't like eating the same breakfast every morning.  Along the same lines, you could make cream of wheat too - can add some protein by adding an egg (like [this](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-enriched-cream-of-wheat-79472) recipe)

* breakfast burritos - filled with eggs/beans/whatever produce is on sale that appeals to you

* breakfast muffins - warm up in the microwave

* egg in a hole

* eggs on toast

if you don't care whether your breakfast is ""traditional"", you could always make soup and reheat it in the mornings."
28355,"Rice and beans made ahead of time.


Breakfast sandwich: toast your bread, fry up an egg and Canadian bacon. Add fresh greens (arugula is a personal favorite).


Try making some baked oatmeal. (An internet search should give you plenty of options). It's basically oatmeal with eggs cooked into it to make it firm, sort of like cake. Mine has lots of fruit and nuts in it. It stores and reheats well so I make it and easy it all week.


I love leftovers for breakfast. I have more food groups for dinner so it is often healthier for me than making something specifically for breakfast in the morning."
28356,I've never done baked oatmeal with eggs in it - my baked oatmeal is literally just oatmeal + ingredients baked in the oven to make it cake-like. I'm definitely going to try it with eggs!
28357,"http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/recipe-for-baked-oatmeal/

The recipe I've used is similar to this. I usual add different fruits and nuts. You can add more 
/different spices. I've also tossed in things like hemp seeds. I was thinking there was more than one egg but I was wrong... Unless I usually make a double batch... I haven't made it since last winter."
28358,Thank you for the link - it looks delicious.
28359,Time to buy eggs and bread. I think this would be the quickest breakfast but I'll look up on the steel cut oats too
28360,Oats are the way to go in my opinion. If you have access to a microwave you can get decent quick oats as well. I add a spoon of peanut butter and it adds a ton of flavor.
28361,"Eggs, eggs, and more eggs. Throw in some diced onions and tomatoes for extra nutrition and taste.  And/or a bit of bacon or sausage.

Chocolate mofucking Chip Pancakes.  Add some banana to that shit too if you want to kick it into top gear."
28362,"Cold winter months I usually make oatmeal with berries. Toss a handful of frozen berries in a 1/4 cup of water in the microwave for about a minute. The berries get warm with the water. Add 2/3 cup of oats and mix. Super fast, filling, and easy. You can also add coffee creamer for creamier berry flavors, or brown sugar/maple syrup and cinnamon  for a change."
28363,"There's no actual need to go with traditional breakfast foods for breakfast. Some leftovers you can reheat in the microwave can make a pretty awesome meal, that will make you feel a lot more energized and feel full for longer than most breakfast foods. Might not be as on-the-go as a smoothie but they are nearly as quick as a bowl of cereal."
28364,"I totally feel you. 

I make a big batch of tofu scramble with loads of veggies, and microwave it for breakfast with some toast."
28365,"1/2 cup quick 1 minute Quaker oats + 1 tablespoon of peanut butter some water and a microwave. Maybe I'm weird but I can eat this for breakfast every single day. 

It keeps me full and energetic until lunch. Great mix of carbs/protein/fats. 

Very quick and easy (prep time about one minute).

 Last but not least CHEAP. Cheap cheap CHEAP cheap Get a BOGO(yer god damn right.) on your peanut butter and you're looking at all of 10 dollars for a month of breakfasts.

And if you need some extra protein toss a scoop of chocolate whey or casin protein in there too. 

I even coined a term for it. ""Soylent Brown"". Tastes as good as it sounds."

28380,What does it mean that it is steel cut and why does it matter?
28381,"The name itself isn't very helpful. 
Basically it is a more close to the original grain. 
It is chewier than the standard fast cook rolled oats. 
I prefer the mouthfeel of steel cut, but there is about zero difference in nutritional value."
28382,"Once you have steel cut or quick 1 minute whole grain oats, you can never go back to the instant oatmeal in the packets. Instant is disgustingly mushy and smooth, like baby oatmeal. Also, way too sweet!

1/2 cup oatmeal, 1 cup milk and 1 Tb. brown sugar mixed in a coffee mug doesn't look like a lot, but it will fill you up for several hours. If I eat this before I leave the house, I'm not even hungry at first break at work (9AM)."
28383,"I'm with you almost all the way. 
I eat my half cup oats with just water though. 
The first time it seems like something is missing, kind of like when you make the switch from sugar and creamer loaded coffee to straight black. 
Trust me though when I say it that a pure cup of straight oats will grow on you."
28384,"I eat my oats dry, raw, and out of a sack tied to my face. Really cuts down on breakfast hassle."

28386,[This article](http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-steel-cut-rolled-and-instant-oats-138355) does a good job explaining the difference.

28393,"Yes. In that same spirit, my pick is Bircher Muesli.

Rolled oats, soaked overnight in a bit of water, with cut up or shaved apple, cinnamon, and (if it's cheap in your area) ground hazelnut. Serve warm or cold with milk. I usually add a wad of natural peanut butter.

Some variations use fruit juices or condensed milk. I find this way too sweet and therefore counterproductive from a health standpoint."
28394,"With a little honey, banana, and other fruit (diced apple, strawberries, blueberries). Amazingly filling, super-quick."
28395,Relatively low calorie too
28396,"So, I make breakfast burritos by the dozen, and freeze them. Then, I take a burrito to work to reheat every day. It works great."
28397,"I wish I'd found out about homemade frozen breakfast burritos earlier. You can toss in whatever you want - I like eggs, onions, red peppers, spinach, cheese, and potato - and they're good as hell reheated. When I did my first batch I wasn't convinced the egg would reheat well but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. Now I cook two huge breakfasts a month and have a delicious breakfast burrito every day! Pro tip: freeze on a cookie sheet, THEN wrap in foil, and they won't be soggy when reheated."
28398,"The trick is to undercook the egg. It's going to continue cooking in the bowl while you assemble and cook a little more when you reheat it. 

I really need to make a big batch myself soon."
28399,Do you have a tip on reheating burritos so that the tortilla isn't all mushy and gross?

28416,"> cheese rolled in tortilla

Here it is, the real winner of a good quick breakfast"
28417,"Breakfast pockets

I make a big batch once a month and keep them in the freezer. Pull one or two out before I go to bed and they're thawed out in the morning. You can toss them in the microwave to have warm but I actually like them better cold.

When I'm doing a batch I make my own pastry and roll it out, cut into circles, then fill with whatever mixture I like. Press sides of pastry together and crimp like a pastie, brush with a bit of egg wash, let rise for 10-15 mins and then bake at 190c for 25 mins.

Fillings are whatever you want to put in. Personally I like to scramble eggs and fry up bacon pieces, onion, shallots, tomato, mushrooms, shredded potato etc and mix all together with a bit of cheese and seasonings and make little balls out of the filling to wrap in pastry.

1.5 cups water

I hate eating sweet things for breakfast, but do it anyway because that's what is quick and fairly healthy. Maybe this is a good alternative that definitely could be made in a (somewhat) healthy way.

If you didn't want to make the batter, you could use pre-made pie crusts, though that might get expensive if you're making enough for a month."

28446,How do you put the avocado on the toast?
28447,Scoop it out and spread it with a fork.... it's fairly intuitive.... (you can get all fancy with slices as well if you want but it's easier to eat if you mush it up a bit)
28448,I don't understand why anyone ever slices avocado for anything. It's so much easier to just mush it up. It's not like it tastes any different. Slices just end up sliding off whatever you put them on.

28465,is vodka a good choice for the liquid?
28466,White rum pairs better with fruit but warm gin by itself works as a no-hassle replacement of breakfast/lunch/dreams/dinner.
28467,This hits a little too close to home
28468,If you like frozen bananas you should try freezing grapes.  My dad manages a table grape vineyard so we always end up with more grapes than we can eat so we freeze them and use them for smoothies.  They're fantastic on their own too!  Like little popsicles!

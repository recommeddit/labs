27223,They got screwed over buying the old Zellers. It was such a good deal when the stores wee being liquidated but their logistics software didn't work properly. They would sell something but the warehouse would never find out. They were saddled with too much overhead because they moved into so many stores at once because of the Zellers deal and it slowly crushed them.. its a pretty interesting story actually. To bad though
27224,"My experience is that in general, Walmart is cheaper than Target."
27225,I meant stock valuation is cheaper
27226,"Because as a supply chain they've been killing the whole omnichannel(brick and mortar/online/delivery) sales and marketing model. My take is it'll eventually trump convenience for customers who would like a choice between picking up on the same day(a la brick and mortar store), or waiting for 1 or 2 day delivery (Amazon) and find a large market niche in there. Interesting to see how Amazon and Walmart would play catch-up given the capital they have at their disposal alongside the advantage of the whole walled garden advantage Amazon has with Prime and Alexa stuff. 

Target to me is a good buy likely to have high returns in coming years with current management helping the company gain a bigger piece of the pie in market segment share(currently poised like AMD in 2017/2018 if I remember the timeline with Lisa Su taking over right) but seems to have a lot of external threats which depend on competitor moves making it risky to buy without diversifying into Walmart, Amazon and Albertsons (and maybe Kroger???). Also unlike how AMD panned out, their market is currently limited to the US, has a lot of fragmented competition and is still only growing share limiting how much more they make out in time."
27227,"Don't forget, Target (and their pals AMZN and WMT) put a lot of moms and pops out of business during the pandemic, and all three will reap those rewards for the foreseeable future"
27228,"One big reason for me was that they were paying floor workers $15/hr even before the pandemic and work shortage. Not only did I see this as moral, but they were never understaffed and attracted more talent than other stores"
27229,"To be fair, Costco did the 15/hr first. But yes, Target was shortly thereafter"
27230,COST should also be on this list
27231,"Personally TSLA, GOOGL, ABNB, DIS and AMZN for sure,

Also perhaps MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, TSM, AAPL, AMD, MU, QCOM, SQ, AFRM, PLTR, Panasonic, UUUU, BYD.

Edit: 

Anyone who knows anything about EVs, auto manufacturing, neural networks and disruptive technologies of the past is nuts about TSLA, im not gonna delve into it. If they solve FSD within 5-10 years, their fair-value valuations literally would go nuts even without the other company segments. If Tsla continues to perform as they have been and solve actual FSD, they will be the first 10, 50, 100T market cap company, im sure of it. If they dont, theyre still ahead of everyone and the lead is widening, margins are amazing already today. (some improvements should be made with quality control, consumer support, infastructure in Eu, etc). If something drastic doesn't happen to the outlook of the company's trajectory, Tsla will very likely be the most valuable company by 2030-2035.

BYD is the probable runner up in the 10-15 year future of BEVs (Different margins are gonna mean whole different valuations tho).

MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL Have huge moats, Google is still secretly a growth company, Azure and AWS are great for the other giants.

Google, Disney, Netflix are the holy trinity of streaming. YT will dominate humans' attention market even more in 5-15 yrs time.

Nvidia, Amd are winning with pocket aces and grabbing all the all-in money they just got from others bluffing (mainly Intel).

Mu, Qcom are for supplying the evergrowing singularity we have achieved.

Square and Affirm I like for fintech plays. High risk high reward. Paypal and Adyen for some safer fintech.

For battery space, Panasonic and CATL if it becomes tradable. If You understand energy needs of the future and dangers of climate change, You know it has to be solved with renewable energy, batteries and nuclear.

If youre into solar, check out JinkoSolar, Canadian solar, First solar, Sunpower, Sunrise, SolarEdge, Enphase, Daqo, (Tesla).

Nuclear let-it-sit could just be UUUU, they also have rare-earth metals, which are bound to increase in price.

Palantir is a new market sector you might regret you didnt get into in 2030. Might be nice to have your hand in that pie a lil bit. Airbnb is the same imo, the outlook is very bullish even though it might not show in guidance. Abnb is secretly dispruting many industries at once.

For e-commerce, besides Amzn, I like Shopify, Sea Limited, Mercadolibre, Jumia, Etsy."
27232,"BYD flies under the radar, but its a Berkshire holding."
27233,MVST is my battery play
27234,I'd say its a high risk high reward one. Panasonic is 10 times safer but potential upside is also probably an order of magnitude less.
27235,Msft googl nvda ASML aapl
27236,I would trade AMD over NVDA personally. Or at least add it.
27237,They are both good in general.
27238,"I got enough stocks.  Who knows whats going to win out.  $10k in ASML in 2011 would now be worth $260k! Wooohooo!

I just started a small position in INMD and ZIM. Those are recent ipos, so who knows how much they'll return. They could 10x over the next 5 years maybe!"
27239,"I see this comment so much. People think NVDA is just a gpu company, so they compare it to the other gpu company. NVDA is SO much more. Go read their annual report then get back to me if you believe differently."
27240,"AMD is still a solid play, mainly for their CPUs not their GPUs"
27241,I don't think NVDA is a bad bet. I'm just more bullish on AMD. ARM combined with INTC losing their status quo are both more favorable to AMD on a 10+ year scale.
27243,"My feeling is AMD is poised better to take market share from Intel.

Last I saw, the Nvidia/Arm deal sounded like it's more and more likely to fall through. But disregarding that, I don't think Nvidia will go anywhere with Arm even if it goes through. They'll be a safe stock to hold, but AMD is more likely to grow.

If I had to choose between only the two, I would pick AMD myself."
27244,ASML is the best of the bunch
27245,I wished I had put $10k in in 2011.  I'd be sittimg on $260k right now!  I had $10k in my bank in those days making .05% maybe :(
27246,Question is when do you sell ;)
27247,"AMZN - I like that they are always on the lookout for growth in new areas

NVDA - Nvidia is really the company of the future. I'm amazed how Mr. Jensen is able to visualize the future. Mad respect. 

CRM - Great management and fanstatic business model

COST - Again, great business model. They have been able to not just sustain their brick and mortar industry, but grow in the age of e-commerce. Also, people are always gonna eat and reproduce. 

INTC - While I do believe, Intel is past its prime, its heavily undervalued at this point. It seems market likes to sell it on any given day - good or bad lol. But I believe in Pat's vision and agree that he is on the right path to reviving the company. Also, they have very generous dividends."
27248,I feel like $CRM is not mentioned enough in these “your top 5 for the next 10 years” discussions. It’s an absolute monster.
27249,"TSM, Tesla, Palantir, INTC, PayPal"
27250,"AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, SQ, SE, SOFI, CRM"
27251,Not so good at counting to 5 ;)
27252,"Disney definitely fits the bill, upstart another one. Palantir and snowflake maybe a little more speculative.

You still can’t deny the ones that have already run. Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon all have huge valuations but I’d still expect them to be in the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now.

Another I like on the long long hold is NVIDIA.

Full disclosure I own all these stocks but I’m not trying to pump it’s an honest opinion."
27253,Thanks for clarifying that you’re not trying to pump the literal largest market cap companies on earth. I have to admit that was my suspicion.
27254,Haha the dryness of this comment is gold. Thanks for the laugh mate
27255,"😂 good point, it’s just I see posts like this and people attempt to pump all kinds of trash they have no interest in holding a week never mind a year. It really annoys me so I wanted to make the point clear. I don’t do pumps, well researched plays with entry and exit strategies is my game."
27256,"Databricks, yet to list, will outpace both Planatir and Snowflake in the long run."
27257,I’d be interested to hear your opinion why. I’ve been eyeing this IPO
27258,Palantir and Snow arent even competitors
27259,Yeah I’m also confused on the comparison there.
27260,Is the IPo coming out in the next future ?
27261,cool st0ry bro - justification?
27262,"TRUST ME, BRO."
27263,"AAPL - ubiquitous brand that can survive just about anything it seems.

DIS -  another ubiquitous brand. Makes money from many different directions: resorts, merchandise, TV and film.

COST - second-largest retailer in North America, loyal customer base, dividend is a small bonus.

KO - ubiquitous brand that offers healthy dividend and  survived several generations in an ever-changing world.

AMZN - it’s a wonder they aren’t running the world yet"
27264,"As a Costco member, I really don't see myself cancelling it for the rest of my life. And that credit card? Heaven on Earth"
27265,"One company I don't see mentioned that perhaps should be - CVS.  

Despite what reddit seems to think... this is not a company that makes the majority of its money on its pharmacy.  Their Caremark and Aetna businesses are health care juggernauts and their MinuteClinic segment is a solid growth play."
27266,The experience of going into their stores sucks. Feels like they're stuck in the 80s. But touché on their other revenue streams.
27268,You been in a Walgreens lately? Makes CVS look futuristic
27269,"People could care less what the ""experience of going into their stores"" is like.  Their competitors are not any better.  That argument is irrelevant."
27271,While the minute clinic gets rolling? There’s been a minute clinic at all my local CVSs for 10+ years now
27272,hell yah. been holding CVS ever since I saw it on blurrys SEC filing a year ago.
27273,Microsoft Google Amazon Apple Lam Research
27274,What does Lam Research really do?
27275,Where is evergrande?
27276,It got acquired by Luckin Coffee. Maybe you missed the news.
27277,You might be mistaken good sir. I heard this Enron place bought both of those companies.
27278,"True, they got massive investment from Lehman brothers"
27279,Michael milken underwrote it
27280,It was also reported that Theranos is partnering with them for their upcoming project
27281,"My never sell stocks are TSLA, NVDA, SQ, FB, CRM, and SNOW. I trade everything else."
27282,Snowflake is good company but I like OKTA. It’s much cheaper at 36 times TTM sales compared to SNOWs 133. Smaller market cap and good management.
27283,Square another great shout
27284,From the start of this year SQ went from $200 > $250 > $200 > $250 3 or 4 times so I thought I'm not going to let that fucker lose me 25% again when it hits ~$250 I'm selling. Bastard stopped following the pattern after I sold.
27285,Same thing happened with crowdstrike for me. I suck at stocks
27286,They're watching us!
27287,I think FB may be running the risk of getting microsofted in the next 10 years. I would have some exits there just in case. Everything else I think are solid.
27288,"What does that even mean?  MSFT has gone 10x in the last decade.  I would love all my stocks to become ""Microsofted"" if that's the case."
27289,"MSFT didn't really move all that much from 2000-2013.  Granted the dot com burst and GFC didn't help, but if you purchase MSFT in 2003, you wouldn't have doubled your money until 2015 (not including dividends)"
27290,I am guessing they’re referring to MSFT before that? I’m not sure but definitely not the last decade.
27291,Check out Microsoft from 2000-2015.
27293,I think it will be the same. FB will just get into some messy fights while they get blamed for tech getting ahead of regulation and very tech dumb politicians looking for a scapegoat to their problems. I still remember watching some moron at congress point to his phone and ask why his granddaughter found mean messages about him on Facebook like Zuckerberg personally put them there.
27294,fb is gonna get fucked i guarantee it. everyone starts to hate it. its going to follow myspace
27295,No one talks about FB doubling down into the AR/VR space. They recently promoted their VP of AR/VR to CTO.

5) energy: XOM -has a high level of planning/forsight, and seems to listen to shareholder meetings, meaning it'll likely keep up with changing energy trends."

27302,Bullish on crippling emotional experiences
27303,puts on therapist's free time
27304,XOM to keep up with changing energy trends? So do we just neglect how they actively fight against climate science paying people to lobby congress against any meaningful changes. Not attacking. Just not the first time i see this opinion while disregarding their role in climate change
27305,"XOM, along with every other energy company, is not interested in going bankrupt.

Oil and gas is the primary product for these companies because it’s economically superior. As soon as something else steals that crown, they’ll switch the producing that.

It’s fairly simple. XOM has the means to pivot 100 times if they want, as do a plethora of other energy companies.

If you don’t want to invest because it’s “against your morals” or whatever, that’s fine…but let’s not pretend it’s a financially-prudent decision"
27306,A lot of big companies 'had the means' to pivot to the next new or best thing in their industry but didn't. Many companies are too unwilling to kill their golden goose to pivot.
27307,I think there are better oil companies outside the US which might perform better longterm.
27308,I like Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-B). Cheaper than XOM and CVX.

27310,"I only have 4 names to share since I own only 5 stocks and one isn't a long-term hold. In order of conviction:

1. ROKU: More households cutting the cable cord should continue to support active accounts, especially internationally + advertising $$$ shifting from linear to streaming. I have a $420 - $500 price target


2. IDXX: Don't confuse this with IDX being pumped from Wall Street Bets. This is a better stock that does diagnostics for pets. Continued innovation in animal Healthcare + more people owning pets + people caring more for their pets = more tests for pets. $745 price target


3. ZTS: Another solid animal health stock, #1 in animal pharmaceuticals. Although it's my #1 best-performing stock, lower on the list because it's more mature at almost a $100b market cap.


4. TTWO: Best-in-breed video game developer best positioned to benefit from Xbox Series X/PS5 console cycle due to higher mix of console revenue + the metaverse since they have proven open-world intellectual property like GTA and Red Dead Redemption. My price target is only $175, but it can go higher depending on news about the pipeline and personally believe this is my #1 upside stock, but with higher risk."

All the others were major ones were flat or had minor declines, whiles Coupang saw a 6% increase. 

There is a good chance this chart isn't showing the full picture (most people cherry pick data), but I've only heard great things and have seen some positive metrics. Coupled with their share price steady decline the last few months, I finally think it might be a good time to get in.

Not saying competition won't step up and they won't have more hurdles, but haven't seen *too many* red flags to stop me from initiating a position."

27383,"Well, my top 5 at this time are already in my portfolio…

1) GOOG - Absolutely dominant company that pretty much controls internet traffic. It has a moat that most will find hard to breach.

2) FB - Social media is too powerful today, and these guys run away from the competition in this department. I’ll be paying attention to the anti-trust battles, but until a competitor can legitimately challenge them, I’m not selling anything.

3) COST - In a world where e-commerce is overtaking traditional commerce, these guys aren’t going anywhere. Company is extremely well run, has a devoted fan base, and can increase their profits with the snap of a finger.

4) MSFT - Businesses run on Microsoft software. A few companies might switch, but all businesses? Unlikely.

5) V - Crypto may threaten them, but does anyone honestly believe that Visa is going anywhere in ten years? Credit and debit cards will still be used, and Visa will likely still be #1 or #2 in that department right alongside MasterCard.

The only reason I didn’t put AMZN on this list is that I got in at a price that, in hindsight, may have been too high. I’m looking for a run up on AMZN before earnings, selling, and waiting for the post-earnings drop to re-enter at a better price.

Three stocks I want to buy and hold for a long time but haven’t yet: ADBE (creativity runs through them now), MMM (industrial giant), and JNJ (stable with amazing dividends). I’m looking to snag them when they pull back to a fairer value; if they don’t, meh, bound to miss plenty."

COST: They're a titan in the retail space, and they have some excellent leadership. Very consumer focused. I expect them to be around for much longer. They don't have the profit margins of some tech companies but all I see when I drive by a location is packed parking lots.

MSFT: They not only have dividends but look at what deals they've been making this year. They signed a fat contract for VR headsets delivered to the Army. The military uses Microsoft's software for everything. Game pass on Xbox has been extremely successful. The Series X is actually competing with PlayStation this time around unlike the Xbox One. I truly believe MSFT is poised for more growth on top of maintaining their dominance in their sector.

MMM: 3M isn't a growth stock in my eyes, I'd hold them solely for the dividend simply put.

AMD: AMD, unlike Intel, doesn't have shitty leadership and is delivering in ways Intel can't. These last two years are indicative of that. Plus, they're very nice to run the options wheel on.

SPXL: I have massive balls and the returns are nuts. If it goes down? Oh well, DCA here I come. VTI is an excellent alternative for those who don't feel comfortable with triple leverage, and it's outperformed the S&P."

Unpopular opinion but I don't find Aamir a natural actor. His script choice and the effort he makes elevates his acting big time. Both SRK and Hrithik are good but can ham like hell with bad directors. Ajay's Rohit Shetty collabs really put a dent on what I think about him. He coasts through without any effort. Akshay is Akshay. I feel like I'm always watching Akshay playing himself. Salman, no comments."
27404,"My exact ranking and opinion!

SRK and HR are the only two truly great and versatile actors in this list. Jodha Akbar, Chak de, Koi Mil Gaya and Swadesh have shown their acting prowess. The only two modern actors who are or can be at their level are Ranbir and Ranveer. 

Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar are so unipolar and non versatile. Maybe they have the potential to be great actors and just don’t choose the scripts to prove it. I feel they are happy playing the same role over and over again.

Amir Khan is a very good actor but people often confuse his dedication and hard work for acting skills. Comparing him to HR and SRK is like comparing Leonardo di Capri with Daniel Day Lewis. 

And Salman…well is Salman. Probably the luckiest guy in the industry to have cracked the code to be just mediocre enough to pull the most crowd to watch his equally mediocre movies. He is like the Adam Sandler of bollywood movies."

27433,They are the biggest star doesn't mean that they are the best actor.
27435,Maybe because the story of the movie is good enough that they don’t have to act that well
27436,No not really? You don't have to be great actor to pull the crowds to theater. Rock isn't a great actor but he still pull audiences to theater
27438,"I am not talking about bodies nor am I saying India has a Rock. My point is you could pull crowds with average acting skills which Rock, Arnold, Stallone and Salman holds and it is universally agreed. They are not bad actors but just average ones"
27440,Not really. They are putting Salman Khan lowest because he is an average actor and you are in denial. You still can't distinguish between stardom and acting skills. You don't have to have both skills to succeed in India.  Salman is a great box office pull but an average actor and no has influenced me and many other. It's you who can't comprehend that Salman is an average actor

Although many here would not like it because of its controversial story line, Naseeruddin Shah was stellar with his performance and so was Sareeka.

27487,Greatest in India? Greatest in Hindi cinema? Or greatest among Khans?
27488,I know most of here would disagree with me but I think Ranveer Singh is probably the greatest method actor this industry has produced in a long time.
27489,This would be true of he was a method actor..
27490,"I think it's too early to say that

Bajirao and Khilji were completely inaccurate to the actual source material, so they can't really be considered method acting

Rest of his work is just about normal"
27491,Isn't Khilji more of the script writers fault tho? Khilji was evil irl but yeah not as uncivilized as SLB makes him out to be.
27492,Yeah but method acting means you would know the irl characteristics of the character and would try to be accurate to them
27493,Certain amount of fiction (or creative freedom) is allowed in movies. Still his role was much believable than say Aamir Khan in Mangal Pandey.
27494,"I don't  know about ""greatest"", it's very subjective imo. I don't believe there even exist any such thing as  ""universally greatesty"". 

But he is a great actor. His presence in movies have worked for me every single time. His performance in Gully Boy was just amazing. I didn't like either of SLB's film that he was in but his performances won my heart. Really excited to see how he pull of kapil paji in '83"
27495,Tbh I disagree. I don’t even think Ranveer has gotten to the level of acting that prime Aamir and SRK did. Of course I still respect your opinion though. Which movies would you say he did a good job of method acting in?
27496,"I think you missed the /s.

27538,OP's list is perfect. Not a film from here to there.
27539,"Thanks, just favourite films and actors of mine.... I am quite interested about your list. Your knowledge on old films is very extensive. I have always taken your recommendations seriously.....+ you are the coolest guy I have seen on this sub which thinking about your age is impressive....."
27540,"Thanks, but I don't think I like five films of a single actor enough to list them. Bollywood movies these days are beyound my comprehension. I would rather watch the villian explaining all his plans to a tied hero and leave him to die near a time bomb than a frail guy kicking 20 guys, each thrice his size, allover like a football. This and all that CGI stuff don't seem real to me. The film should just flow infront of you..

Still there are some bollywood movies that I can watch again and again. Here are some of them-

Guide, Jewel Thief, Sholay, Don (1978), Pyasa, Parineeta (1953), Garam Hawa, Agneepath (1990), Namak Haram, Chupke Chupke, Sanghrash (1968), Angoor, Khakee, Shakti, New Delhi Times, Pratiggya..

There will be more but only these are coming to mind right now."

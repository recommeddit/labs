49495,I'm at working atm but when I get home I'll send you a list.
49496,"Thank you!


 
Popular﻿ 2k gaming monitor prices:

-Samsung LC27HG70: 480€

-DELL S2719DGF: 496€

-HP OMen 27: 617€

-Acer Predator XB271HUA (TN): 560€

-Acer Predator XB271HUA﻿ (IPS): 750€

-AOC AGON AG271QX: 473€

-Asus ROG SWIFT PG279Q﻿: 775€

-Acer xf270hua: 460€"
49497,"Definitely the XF270HUA (assuming it's the AHVA model). 

The G-Sync equivalents (PG279Q﻿, XB271HUA﻿) are almost €300 more, and the TN options are grossly overpriced (S2719DGF, HP Omen 27, XB271HAU, AG271QX).

While the TN options might be marginally faster, they are pretty mediocre (Omen 27, BX271HAU, AG271QX) or overpriced (S2719DGF), and the XF270UA will be almost as fast while having far better image quality.

The C27HG70 will be the fundamentally slowest option, though having the best contrast ratio."
49498,Thank you for the time to answer me. The Xf270hua seems like the most reasonable option
49499,Wait for this to release in late August:  [https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/a4371716](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/a4371716)

49501,!remind me in 15 hours
49514,"The main difference is the refresh rate (hz). Many gaming monitors have 120hz or 144hz which means that every second, the screen refreshes 120 or 144 times. This will make games smoother."
49515,"they have ""gaming"" in the title. Focus on colors, response rate, and resolution. Also reviews from trusted sources.

in general ""gaming"" monitors will tend to have freesync or gsync, will tend to have higher refresh rates. but monitors not labeled ""gaming"" can also have those things and they can be excellent. 

> .E. a dell 1080p 60hz monitor and a dell 1080p 60hz gaming monitor

possibly nothing at all"
49516,"Monitors for general use don’t have an emphasis on input lag, colours, response times or anything. They are for things like web browsing. Cheap and it just works,

Gaming monitors have emphasis on input lag. They generally come in 120hz+ refresh rate to make experience as smooth as possible. Colours are good  and repose times are low.  In this category there are 3 sub groups, TN, VA, IPS. If you’d like to know more, reply.

There are other monitors like professional editing ones that are 4k and have 10bit HDR to edit things, these have low input lag and response times as these things aren’t difficult to implement and the monitor is already expensive, adding a little more manufacturing processes isn’t a problem."
49517,"What is the difference between the monitor types that you listed? TN, VA, and IPS?"
49518,"I know from experience the ips/pls will have better color compared to a tn.

Most gamers go for a tn because it has a faster refresh.

A lot of the ips/pls panels are overclockable with a proper cable type.

My qnix qx2710 is oc to 100hz with a dvi-d cable atm and looks great.

I watch a lot of movies and game a little, so I went the pls route.

You might be happier with a tn if you play FPS shooters a lot."
49519,"TN is the worst in everything besides response times and price. They're used mostly in cheap gaming monitors since they can achieve high refresh rates at low costs. They tend to have a grey-ish image quality tho because they can't produce decent contrast. 

IPS are your ""good, all around"" monitors, even though their contrast still isn't fantastic (this is a downside of LCDs in general). Their quality though varies a lot. Just because a monitor has an IPS panel, it doesn't mean it's good or has good image quality. 

VA improves a lot on IPS' contrast, but sacrifice viewing angles. For gaming though this isn't a big issue, but it is for office use. They're mostly used in high-end TVs because a good VA panel is basically the best kind of LCD you can buy and they're now coming to the monitor market too but they're hard to find."
49520,"Competitive shooters, ONLY play cs:go competitively —> TN  e.g xg240R, xg2401

Play RPG games, or anything with graphics that look nice. You watch movies. You may also play shooters. You play any of the listed —> VA e.g AOC c24g1

Any kind of gaming + video/photo editing/architecture work —> IPS or PLS or AHVA. (All are the same basically, AHVA is used for the gaming 144hz-165hz ones, PLS/IPS are used in those high-end 10 bit HDR monitors (4k@60hz w/ true 10bit and true HDR) e.g idk, but def not for you."
49521,"like what was already said, high refresh rate is nice on gaming monitors, versus normal ones that have a max of maybe 90 hertz.

Another thing, however, is response time. usually TV's don't have a low response time, meaning there is slight input lag from the time you move your mouse to the TV displaying the movement. You will definitely notice a difference if you do decide to go for an actual monitor. But if you don't necessarily need/want a high refresh rate, any 1080p monitor will do fine"
49522,"For non FPS and/or racing type games, would the refresh rate have that much of an impact. 

For, say, RPG/RTS games and the such? Man getting back into this whole thing has so much fun stuff to dig into/learn about again."
49523,"Always fun to get into this kind of stuff. 

In my opinion, it's not as important in those types of games, but there is a difference you can slightly tell, depending on your framerate and refresh rate of course. The buttery smoothness in general stuff even, it's so hard to go back to 60hz on my laptop. 

I would say if you need to save the money, a normal 60hz monitor would do fine. If not, I would definitely recommend a 120hz or 144hz monitor. Even if you can't tell the difference in game, it's still nice to have regardless."
49524,"None howsoever. There are many high refresh rate monitors out there that don't look or are advertised as ""gaming monitors"", even though they make for good gaming monitors.

Always look at the real specs of a monitor and not at what the vendor advertises: panel type, resolution, refresh rate, input lag, contrast ratio etc."
49525,There might be a different in response times. Gaming monitors usually have a 1ms response time where as a general monitor will have around a 5ms response time or sometimes even more than 5ms. This means that there will be a shorter time between when you left click and when you see the gun fire in a game on a gaming monitor than on a regular monitor however in reality it is hard to tell the difference. To do this and still keep the price down gaming monitors will often use a TN lcd panel which won't have as good color reproduction and contrast as a IPS lcd monitor which often have higher response times than TN panels. However if you want the best of both worlds you can still find IPS monitors with low response times but they cost more usually.
49526,No monitor has real 1ms response time. Cut the BS.
49527,Yeah your right no monitor has a true 1ms response time but the point of my comment was to explain the difference between gaming monitors and other monitors so I just used the common specs listed by manufacturers. I didn't feel the need to try to explain why monitor response time listings are wrong bc I felt it was off topic to the question.
49528,"You also mixed up response times and input lag.

Input lag is the time it takes for the monitor to react to the command and start changing.

Response time is the time it takes for a pixel to change from one shade of a colour to another."
49529,I'm also aware of that but do you really think the guy asking this question cares about those details. From what I read it didn't seem like he knew much about monitors so I tried to keep my answer pretty basic and not flood him with information. Like most things monitors are a very complex topic when you look into it and not everyone cares or needs to learn every single thing about them.
49530,"Ok, I get your line of thinking."
52252,"I didn't expect to see *Endtroducing* here. I think there are better and more classic rap instrumentals (Dilla's *Donuts* for example), tho I'm fine with DJ Shadow too. Also didn't expect *Atrocity Exhibition*, but I think it fits here.

Edit: the lack of *Stankonia* is surprising too."
52253,">the lack of Stankonia is surprising too.

Or ATLiens (I'm just a sucker for that album because it's how I 1st discovered Outkast)"
52254,I’m pretty sure Aquemini is their highest rated on rym
52255,"Oh, right. I knew Stankonia was their highest rated on metacritic, that's why I said it (I just checked it out and their earlier albums aren't even there)."
52256,rap instrumentals? its not rap if its instrumental and none of the songs on dilla donuts have rap.
52257,What is a better name then?
52258,"I honestly just call them beats, that's how I categorise instrumentals in my library."
52259,hiphop instrumental. this is literally the correct term for it lol how do you not know this. Its not a big deal but hiphop doesnt mean rap and youre literally on hiphop101
52260,you could correct them without being a condescending douche though
52261,Foreal! What a lame 🤣🤦‍♂️
52262,"I'm not american, in my country we call the entire genre ""rap"". Thanks for correcting me, actually."
52263,"Top 10 Douche Bags According to Reddit

1. illdizi
2. 
3."
52265,"You're our fav douchebag, tho. Don't let anybody tell you different :\^)"
52266,Am i the only weird one who prefers Low End Theory to Midnight Marauders??
52269,I even like their first album more than those two...it's not as polished but that might be why I like it
52270,"Yea,I see what you mean. I think there was something odd about the 3 albums in terms of Sonic progressions but each album stands on each own"
52271,"Yea,I see what you mean. I think there was something odd about the 3 albums in terms of Sonic progressions but each album stands on it's own"
52272,"Yeah, they're all classic, it's close ranking them for sure but whenever I think about the tracks on the first album...I think the opening track Push It Along is one of the best openers of any album. Who opens their debut album with an almost 8 minute long track? Tribe. And then I've always had a soft spot for all the tracks outside the singles - Luck of Lucien, After Hours, Youthful Expression, Rhythm, Go Ahead in the Rain...I love em all. And then closing with Description of a Fool is so dope to me"
52273,They're both incredible.
52275,"very respectable list, all of these are classics. even kendrick and danny brown's albums."
52276,"I would say that EITHER *Pimp* or *good kidd* would belong on a top 10 list, but I don't think both. 

&#x200B;

I don't think *Atrocity Exhibition* is top 10 material (and i say this as a fan of Brown since *Hybrid*).

&#x200B;

I think my one controversial take here would be that DJ Shadow might not belong in a top 10, but it is a classic and influential and important etc. 

&#x200B;

Also, for a top 10 list no entries that came out prior to the 90s? No Rakim, Kool G., Schoolly, etc.? I believe top 10 lists should have variety that represent the best hip-hop has offered acroos the spectrum. 

&#x200B;

Overall, if this was someone's personal list, I would say they know their shit. But as a ""Best of all time list"", nah."
52277,To Pimp a butterfly imo is Kendricks best album and the best rap album of the 2010’s tho I’m new to hip hop
52278,"I’ve tried so many times to like Kendrick but man I just don’t get it. I think it’s his voice that throws me off. Also I’m a sucker for College Dropput and I think I’d switch it out with MBDTF. Not having NWA on this list is criminal. Top 10 lists of an entire genre are almost impossible, and it’s all subjective anyway!"
52279,I think a lot of people would agree with you.
52280,I’m surprised Low End Theory made it over MM
52281,"Good call.  
I prefer Marauders myself, but Low-End Theory always gets more love."
52282,I'm mainly surprised bc MM seems to be generally acknowledged as their Magnum Opus
52283,"Impossible, Lil Pump isnt on this"
52284,Yeah they forgot cardi b too
52285,kendricks so new to the game compared to older people like nas and em and the man is a cemented legend already
52286,I mean their only contenders are their earliest works as well
52287,"if your talking bout people like nas and em, totally right. people always say that they’re new stuff isn’t like MMLP or Illmatic"
52288,"yes, i twas"
52289,Good list!
52290,east coast / boombap album gets too much love and west coast / g-funk album often ignored in that site
52291,Not really
52293,">Without NWA, rap would be nothing

Without Jamaican toasting, DJ Kool Herc, or west African griots, modern rap would be nothing. How far back do you want to go? NWA was certainly integral to the west coast rap scene during the late 80s and their cultural impact on rap was felt well into the 90s, but to make such declarative and hyperbolic statements as ""rap would be nothing"" makes you sound like a gatekeeping rap elitist."
52295,NWA is pretty much just Ice Cube + Eazy E lets be real
52296,And dre
52297,Project Blow.
52298,"NWA were super influential, sure but Straight Outta Compton just isn't a GOAT status album. Other albums from the same era, like It Takes A Nation Of Millions... hold up better as albums. Influence is a whole different story to an albums' quality, otherwise we'd be calling Rappers' Delight the greatest hiphop track OAT"
52300,"Yeah I get what you're saying, on rateyourmusic they don't really take that into account though. It's not that they misunderstand hiphop or anything, but regardless of genre most users take each album by itself disregarding anything other than just music, lyrics, production and the albums' presentation. Since users still rate albums from now, to gauge an album on it's influence would create a bias (and there is already a lot of those on there)"
52301,"The 90s East Coast bias was always justified though: better producers, better lyricists, better concepts, classic LPs like Illmatic, The Infamous, Ready To Die, 36 Chambers, OB4CL, Capital Punishment, IDAHIH, The Sun Rises In The East....plus it's the damn birthplace of this genre. What's to hate?

Also, most of the 90s West Coast g-funk was fucking dumpster juice anyway."
52302,"I agree 100%. East Coast always brought the best flava to hip hop. Not saying West Coast G Funk was ass  2pac, Snoop, etc were all goats in they own right."
52303,"And I wasn't even hating on the entire subgenre. Death Row had some dope releases (The Chronic, Doggystyle, All Eyez...) plus I dig DJ Quik's work. But the whole thing became a cheap gimmick and a damn parody of itself with that W-throwing, over-the-top misogyny, khaki suits, 64s, and them tired ass whistle beats.

Be honest with me. Outside of Pac, who did the really have that was a credible contender for the throne against the likes of Biggie, Nas, Jay, Prodigy, Wu-Tang, Big L, Rakim, AZ, Jeru, Redman, and Boot Camp? 

Snoop who fell off hard after Doggystyle? Mack 10's wack ass? Jayo Felony? Daz? Tray Dee? Fucking E-40?"
52304,Tbh. No one. East coast had it locked
52305,"Absolute rubbish. I suspect these polls present a complete biased towards the demographic that uses rateyourmusic, and that's it. Ironically, it think it maps over pretty well for the avg Reddit Hip Hop fan."
52306,Just out of curiosity - what albums in your opinion deserves more to be on this list and which shouldn't be there?
52307,Ready to die from biggie tbh
52309,It's just the highest rated hiphop albums on rateyourmusic
52310,Basically standard issue list except for a couple
52311,Ready to die - biggie smalls
52312,Pretty standard list. Didn't expect to see Danny Brown or DJ Shadow though.
52313,Great list not sure which I would take out but I think Piñata by Freddie Gibbs needs to be on there
52314,How is Reasonable Doubt not on here
52316,Wow how isn't Marshall Mathers LP not in there.
52317,"There's a lot more to hip hop than Eminem, just sayin'."
52319,"TPAB received widespread acclaim when it released what are you talking about? And I think you can pretty easily deny MMLP being one of the greatest albums for all time, for numerous reasons, such as the poorly aged beats, repetitive lyrical matter, and being overlong."
52321,"Yeah man, all those 808s and high hats on TPAB  are going to age poorly then I’ll be eating my remark. Oh wait."
52323,Have you even listened to TPAB? The joke was that there are barely if any 808s and hi hats on the album most of it was done with live instruments lol
52324,">Theres a lot more to hip hop than Kendrick, just sayin'.

You should be telling the majority of rym's user base this, not me. I don't think he should have *two* albums in the top 10."
52326,">	But eminem being top 5 ever is an iron clad fact.

It really isn’t though. It’s an opinion."
52328,"I’ll bite. I acknowledge he was the most succesful rapper in the early 00’s. I was excited about the SSLP and the MMLP. Loved his verses on Devil’s Night, but was slightly dissapointed when The Eminem Show came out. Loved the 8 Mile soundtrack.

Nothing after that *really* excited me. The technical ability is there but I think he has a bad taste in beats and hooks. Great rapper who makes music that sounds bad to me. And making good music is an important factor to me to be a good rapper. Which is why he stays out of the top 5 to me."
52330,"I’ve been listening actively listening to hiphop since ‘93. I listened to Eminem non-stop from ‘00 until ‘05. So it’s been about 15 years since he was my favorite rapper. I revisit his music sometimes, but I love 2pac, Biggie, Snoop Dogg, Wu Tang and Mobb Deep’s music more. 

I used to love every lyrically complex rap out there. Now it’s less important to me. I still like rappers like Kendrick, Pusha T and Joey Bada$$. But I also like Travi$ Scott, A$AP Rocky, Young Thug, Drake (sometimes) and 21 Savage. Different types of raps for different moods and occasions."
52331,"Yeah you might not like him cause he is a bit mainstream, but he has put out one the best hip hop albums of all time and no one can deny that."
52332,"Just a few surprises but that’s a good list, maybe add doggystyle and a Tupac and mobb deep album, and there gotta be an outkast album"
52333,"If you’re gonna add those, which do you remove?"
52334,"Endtroducing, for all eyez on me and Reasonable doubt for Atrocity Exhibition"
52335,this is wrong cause nav isn’t on here
52336,Damn no. 10 really shocked me. It's a good album but Atrocity Exhibition never really stood out to me like that.
52337,"I love hip hop, but I guess I can only classify really as the radio listening type. But in my opinion I think in order for an album to  be the greatest of all time, they must have somewhat gained a bit of recognition in the mainstream.  Having said that, I find the lack of Eminem a little disappointing. I know a lot of hip hop heads discredit the dude for one reason or the other, but damn that album made headlines. And also risking contradicting myself,
 I find including kanye a bit disappointing. I always found kanye to have made gteat music, but not greatest of all time. I find the character kanye is much more interesting than his music, and sometimes I think when so many people tells me he is supposed to be some kind of genius musician, I just don't hear it. But yeah , I agree, Kendrick is one of a kind."
52338,No Jay-Z ? Whack list. Also this list seems like it was compiled by someone new to this sub.
52339,No hov and no ready to die is tough to see. Newer music like Kendrick have an advantage because nas didn’t have rateyourmusic back in the day. Illmatic would be higher if he did
52340,"Really a Kendrick album is better than a biggie or Tupac album, I’m sorry to me that is  impossible but to each there own idc stop making generations a excuse, it just not better"
52341,"I think TPAB is better than any pac album, but ready to die definitely could be better"
52342,Are you me? We have similar hip hop taste
52343,"This isn't my top 10 list, lol."
52344,Good list but needs MMLP
52345,"No, it doesn't."
52346,"Endtroducing is not even a complete album, it’s a production set"
52347,*Endtroducing.....* is an experimental hip-hop/instrumental hip-hop album. It still qualifies as an album irrespective of whatever meaningless criteria you're using to define what is or isn't album material.
52348,"I’ll repeat what you said one more time so he can understand. No it doesn’t, not a classic, didn’t do anything for hip hop, poorly aged lyrics and beats, no classic hits"
52349,"How do the five best tracks on TPAB hold up against 

Juicy  
Everyday Struggle  
Things Done Changed  
Respect  
Warning  


Or 


It ain’t hard to tell  
Memory Lane  
NY State of Mind  
Life’s a Bitch  
The World is Yours  

Or 

Dead President II  
D’Evils  
Regrets  
Feelin It  
Can I Live  

Or

Kill You  
The Way I Am  
Stan  
I’m Back  
Who Knew  

And so on.

I like Kendrick but the internet dickriding and recency bias with him is exhausting.  There’s a list that says he has the two best albums in hip hop history? Idk if there’s a single song on TPAB that you could even put in the same playlist as the 20 songs I just listed."
52350,"I think songs like u, how much a dollar cost, the blacker the berry, Wesley's theory, alright, and sing about me can be in the same conversation as these songs"
52351,"List is shit to be honest.  But any top 10 is going to fall down somewhere.  But Kendrick did not make the 2 best hip-hop albums of all time.  Kanye has not made a top 10 hip-hop record of all time.  No De La Soul, Mobb Deep, Fugees, Dre, Outkast, Biggie, Common, Jay Z."
52352,"“Kanye has not made a top 10 hip-hop record of all time”

Cap"
52353,"> Fugees

*The Score* will always be in my personal top 10."
52355,">without mentioning 2001,

2001 is classic but don't you think Chronic is better? I do but that's just my 2 pennies."
52356,"> Kanye has not made a top 10 hip-hop record of all time. 

Hard disagree"
52357,"I don't think Kendrick, Danny Brown or shadow belong in the top 10. Those are all great albums but I'd sooner include - ready to die, ob4cl, blueprint, mmlp, paid in full, college dropout, black album, get rich or die trying, it's dark hell is hot, Wu Tang forever"
52358,"Yeah,  those are all much better albums."
52359,"I enjoy every album on that list but come on. It’s complete trash. Like somebody mentioned before, if that was your own personal top 10 list then cool , great list, music is about what you love and how it makes you feel. But when making an all time list ? Nope . Complete bullshit . Any top 10 list has to include these albums in my opinion ;

Illmatic,
Ready to die ,
Me against the world,
All eyes on me ,
ATLiens ,
Low end theory ,
Reasonable doubt ,
The score ,
It takes a nation ,
Only built 4 Cuban linx,"
52360,Terrible. Astroworld is the best album of all time right after goes beerbongs & bentleys and hollywood’s bleeding
52361,i hope ur joking
52362,"That is a garbage ass list. I only agree with GZA, Nas, Tribe, and Madvillainy"
52363,I think this sorts of lists should do a one album per artist. Other than that all albums are fine af and well deserved to be on the list.
52364,"This album is, obviously, not accurate, lol. About 50% of these even deserve to be in the conversation."
52365,"Good list, but gkmc shouldn’t be there imo, a bit unfair that Kendrick takes the top 2 spots. Also I wouldn’t really count Endtroducing as a hip hop album"
52366,"I like it, but would cut kanye and danny brown. Those 2 are way too overrated by their fans, as much as I do love some Danny."
52367,"There is no fucking way that Kendrick Lamar is better than the Wu-Tang Clan. I mean c'mon, they've been around for nearly 30 fucking years, Kendrick Lamar has only been around half that long and in a few years he'll be back in the ""No one gives a shit"" category while Wu-Tang will still be remembered 50 years from now.

It'd be like comparing Jinjer to fuckin' Metallica."
52368,"You can't just give more props to a group because they've been around longer. Also, even if you disagree that TPAB and GKMC are top 10 rap albums oat, kendrick will still have a legacy left behind because TPAB and GKMC are two of the most critically acclaimed rap albums of the 2010s"
52369,"We're talking about the fucking Wu-Tang Clan though,  a band that is so iconic that they are world renowned and their logo is instantly recognized by people from 6 to 60, white, black,  Mexican,  Asian,  all over the world. I know dudes born in the fucking 1950s that say Wu-Tang forever. 

Kendrick Lamar is best known for being a spoiled brat and chewing out a fan for not censoring herself with a word he used 15 times in one of his songs. I have no problem not using said word in everyday use, BUT if you pay good money to go to this guy's show, you clearly aren't racist, you're not going to go burn crosses in front of this guy's house, you love his music,  you should be able to sing a song that he is playing and you are a fan of. 

TBQH, this is one thing that has made it harder for me to get into hip hop in general. Could you imagine if icons like KISS or Metallica were to chew out their fan base for being immersed in their song?"
52370,So Top 10 *most overrated* hip-hop albums of all time
52371,Imho: 2014 Forrest Hills Drive is almost able to go toe to toe with To Pimp A Butterfly. The album was completely comprised of songs that were all individually good enough to be singles.
52401,what?
52373,😐
52374,"Kendrick Lamar has 2 albums on the list, DJ Shadow made it, fucking sloppy seconds Kanye is on there, yet there is not any Blueprint, any Me Against The World, any Ready To Die, any MM FOOD. Fuck this bullshit, and fuck the World for forgetting true Hip Hop and getting into the bullshit of those cunts who changed the culture into RAP."
52375,"I hope you didn't put a hole in your drawers after shitting them that hard over literally nothing, oml 💀"
52377,"Lmao dude I don't like Fantano or listen to the alternative shit you're talking about. I listen to east coast boom bap revival like Griselda, Crimeapple, Roc Marciano, etc. I admittedly don't listen to classic albums most of the time, but that's my fault because I do that with every genre I listen to, just skip over the required shit for whatever reason."
52379,"I don't mind what classics I've heard (36 Chambers is one of my favorite discs I own), I just don't know why I don't check them out nearly as regularly as the stuff I usually peep. I don't think it's the elitist aspect, because besides the YouTube comments (which don't matter to me because all YouTube comments sections are garbage), those kinds of people are a fraction of a minority. I guess I like having a dependable backlog of sweet records, idk"
52380,"I like Kendrick Lamar. Dont get me wrong. I failed to clarify that. I dont like the rest, and I dont care what anyone says."
52381,There's a distinction between not liking something and bitching that OP's top ten isn't exactly yours
52382,"Its not OPs. Its rateyourmusics. Get yo facts up. And I aint bitching, but I am mad. Yeah."
52383,Lmao I assumed it was OPs because everyone who uses RYM has that same damn list
52384,"Just because I use rym, that doesn't mean I agree with their top 10s, lol."
52385,"Yeah I figured that out later in the thread, I completely misread the post lmao. Thought you were saying it was your top 10 on RYM"
52386,"I dont know how to reply to yo shit. Dont beat round the bush with this sarcasm shit, if yous being sarcastic. Come straight at me with what you on about."
52387,"? I was just saying I assumed the list was OP's top albums on RYM rather than the whole website's because everyone who uses RYM has that exact same list, that's why I said it was OP's list. My b"
52388,"Aight bet. Thats what I meant when I said fuck they list, cuz I dont care if its a single person list, cuz everyone feel different shit in music and its not rigid rules for everyone to follow. But these companies need to keep they noses outta our culture and shit, they aint represent no streets and no communities. Plus they end up fucking each list in the ass like this."
52389,">But these companies need to keep they noses outta our culture and shit, they aint represent no streets and no communities

Rym isn't claiming to do that, though. It's simply a website intended to give users the chance to review, rate, and catalogue music - that's it.

I'm sure the main demographic of rym (suburban white teens and middle- to upper-class white adults) is one reason why this particular top 10 looks the way it does."
52390,lmao buddy why are u so mad over people giving their opinion. you have yours and the people who rated those highly have theirs.
52391,Nah fam how can someone NOT appreciate the albums that changed Hip Hop into its Golden Age? That does not make sense to me.
52392,so you're implying that some albums are objectively better? that's not how opinions work buddy.
52394,that's literally what opinions are lmao. there's no right or wrong opinions.
52395,"They is my nigga. Big album changed so many rapper styles, brung a whole new kinda level ro the rap game. Niggas wasnt calling Big King of New York for nothing. And Pac changed the whole approach niggas was taking to Hip Hop with Me Against The World. Im talking this shit in POV of big companies btw. I dont give 2 shits bout a solo niggas top albums, cuz everyone feel different musics. Its not that deep when it comes to single people. But big companies can suck my dick if they aint have nothing better to do with they mouth if they gone disrespect Hip Hop like that."
52396,"just because an album is influential doesn't mean it's objectively better. opinions on music are subjective. your opinion is worth the same as anyone else's, and there's no right or wrong opinions about music."
52397,"Nigga fuck off. Polite as shit. I am done, else imma start losing my shit in this bitch."

52400,"Ab-Soul > Kendrick, Control System is still the best TDE album (and I'd put Sun's Tirade at No. 2)"
52402,"I'll slow it down for you, Kendrick is massively overhyped and not even the best rapper on TDE. Ab-Soul is. His album Control System is better than either of the Kendrick albums on this list."
52403,huh?
52404,"I would probably change around the order a bit, but I think this list is fine 

I might make some swaps like I would definitely have Ready To Die in there, so I think I’d swap it for Entroducing, I think that’s the weakest link. 

Liquid Swords is overrated imo, if I were to put one of Wu Tang’s solo it would be only built 4 Cuban link, but I’m not sure it would be in my top 10 

Piñata is a personal favourite so I’ll swap it for Liquid Swords 

Atrocity Exhibiton never stood out to me like it did a lot others so I’d probably have the last spot be a tie between The College Dropout, Marshall Mathers LP and maybe something by 2pac or Outkast 

But this still looks pretty good to me


Edit: Forgot Lifestyle Ov Da Poor And Dangerous, that’s very easy top 10 for me"
52405,mbdtf should at least be number 2
52406,"It's not accurate. But those are good albums. Madvilliany and Endtroducing are definitely not top 10 albums of all time but that doesn't take away the Classic album status. Kendrick bring on there twice is laughable but those are great albums. Nas, Wu tang and tribes albums are debatable. I haven't heard Danny Browns album so I can't say much there. Kanye has a couple Classics that can be debated over MBDTF. Just my opinion though."
52407,"you are definitely wrong about madvillainy though, it is definitely one of the best hipho albums of all time, literally every song is done well and doom and madlib both bring their best. Endtroducing is kind of boring compared to dillas donuts, but it is undoubtedly an enjoyable classic but i dont think any hhh would put it in a top 10, so i agree on that part."
52408,"i don't think anyone is ""debating"" Illmatic deserving to be on this list. It's easily one of, if not the best rap albums ever made. Nas has had a ton of shit albums and songs, but I don't think anyone could argue that the album that contains NY State of Mind, Represent, Life's a Bitch, Halftime, and the World is Yours doesn't deserve to be in the top 10."
52409,"Also how tf isn't Madvillainy top 10? It's THE defining work of DOOM, a goat contender that is the face of underground hip-hop. If the long intros and sampling aren't your thing, I get it, but on a list of hip-hop's best you have to acknowledge DOOM."
52410,"How isn't it top 10? There's so many great albums that have done more for hip hop than Madvilliany. It's a Classic, sure. But did it do what the Chronic did? What about Ready to Die? What about All Eyes On Me? Is it at genre defying as 808s and Heartbreaks was? No. But it's a great album."
52411,"I said ""debatable"" because of its ranking on the top ten list. I'm not saying Illmatic isn't top 10. It's rank on that list? Debatable."
52412,"my bad, I completely misunderstood you."
52413,It's good. I probably should have explained a little better what I meant.
52414,"Hi it's not accurate. but those are good albums. madvilliany and endtroducing are definitely not top 10 albums of all time but that doesn't take away the classic album status. kendrick bring on there twice is laughable but those are great albums., I'm dad."
52415,Wait a minute...
52416,Hahaha kendrick lamar over illmatic
52417,IWW > Illmatic

52171,"I think you can skip Jesus is King from Kanye

I'd also add The Eminem Show and The Chronic"
52172,"Are these definitive? I absolutely love this list. It’s very experimental though. For someone who just got into hip-hop, (I’m assuming this person is since they just listened to illmatic) I don’t think Danny brown is a good representation of hip-hop. Yes, it is an amazing album. It’s my favorite rap album of all time, in fact. But I’ve lived most of my life building a foundation for hip-hop, and yet it was still a little tough listening to AE for the first time. It’s rough, beautiful, intense, calming, and anxious. I do think man on the moon is definitive, you definitely have definitive albums on your list, I just think it takes some experienced ears to fully enjoy Danny brown, earl sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, I’d also put Aesop rock in that grouping. (I know you didn’t mention him, but I don’t wanna leave him unmentioned)"
52173,Great list but it’s like a crime to exclude OB4CL when you got 36 Chambers and Liquid Swords on there.
52174,"nigga said definitive hip hop albums lol....  

Travis Scott and Tyler do not count as definitive hip-hop lol"
52175,"rodeo has influenced the past five years of hip hop  
wolf is some of tylers best, although i do agree flower boy would have been a better spot in retrospect"
52176,"and what has the past fives years of hip hip given us? 99.9% trash...  
Scott does not influence lyricists....    
Tyler's best is still garbage compared to real hip hop artists my nigga.  

I ain hating on ya, your preferences are your preference and are subjective... but you can't lead the man on saying they are definitive hip hop artists....  when you left a lot of real niggas off your list... feel me?"
52177,"Travis and Tyler have both been around for roughly a decade and have built solid discogs. While one can argue Tyler isn't super influential outside the Odd Fututre era, one can't deny the impact Travis has already left on rap. That Travis/Thugger sound has kind of defined the last 10 years of rap outside of that counter of ""lyrical miracle spiritual individual"" bullshit style of rap."
52178,"I respect ya opinion.... but both these niggas are not classified as 'definitive hip-hop artists'  
not even on the bubble...."
52179,"again it was mostly off the top of my head, i feel you but a lot of modern music is great as well"
52180,also just because travis doesnt influence lyricists doesnt mean he hasnt influenced....
52181,I'm OG... grew up on the pioneers...  but I peep a lot of modern cats for the sake of keeping the art alive... there are plenty of gems out there.... but record companies exploited our culture and have flooded the hip hop scene with shit artists.... because the demand is there and will pay....    just making it harder to find those gems....  there are some legends out there in the making... Joyner being one
52182,There’s a lot more to rap than lyricism imo. There’s lots of great modern hip hop that doesn’t have the most profound lyricism.
52183,no doubt... but lyricism is essential.... if ya content is garbage or fake... you ain a hip-hop artist.... but thats the OG nigga in me speakin.... you GOTTA have bars
52184,"just bc Travis doesn't influence lyricists doesn't take his influence away. Now, personally I wouldn't really group his music in as ""hip hop"" in the traditional way, so I can see where you're coming from. I kinda see Trap as a different beast entirely, something that was once a subgenre but now it's just a genre of its own accord. To say Travis didn't influence hip hop, though, because he didn't influence lyricists is like saying The Sex Pistols didn't influence Rock bc they didn't influence pure musicality and talent on instruments. Sure, they didn't influence what the genre was built on, but they took that genre and built something completely new out of it. If that isn't influence idk what is"

52194,"I'd recommend checking producers you enjoy the sonics of. there's dudes like Prince Paul who produced the first 3 De La Soul albums which are all amazing.

And then the Gravediggaz album he produced is one of the earliest examples of horrorcore, has RZA on it.

And then the Handsome Boy Modelling School album 'So How's Your Girl' with Dan the Automator and a slew of dope rappers. Its one of the most diverse hip hop albums you'll hear with mind blowing tunes on it.

Some other random shit. Since people say Doom but don't know it as well. check the album before he became the villain. KMD's Black Bastards - its amazing.

Check El-P's I'll Sleep When You're Dead.

Check Jurassic 5 - Quality Control (or any album besides their last)

Check Dizzee Rascals Boy In Da Corna - timeless classic, so banging.

Fuck listening to just American hip hop, ya a stooge if you take that path.

Check Jehst Return of the Drifter.

Check Betty Ford Boys

Check Pete Rock and CL Smooth - Mecca and the Soul Brother

Check Hilltop Hoods - The Hard Road

Check DJ Shadow - Endtroducing

52434,Can u elaborate? Because Illmatic ain't in my top 5 classic albums either but it's far from overrated
52436,"Thats a interesting perspective, I always thought the album sonically flowed well.. and all the hottest producers at the time were on it but somehow the project had the same sound of that makes sense .... But I mite just listen to it n refresh with an open mind about what u said"
52437,"Oh it flows well and it isn’t bad, it’s just a bit bland IMO. Other Albums like TPAB, Liquid Swords, Deltron, Madvillainy, and a Piece of strange flow together well but still have unique/interesting production on each track."
52438,"Oh gotcha gotcha, I see what u mean now"
52439,"Your opinion of Illmatic is boring and ridiculous.

It's 10 songs at just under 40 minutes how the fuck can that album be boring.  It's perfectly sequenced, lyrics are flawless along with the production. You make no sense."
52440,Lol it isn’t sonically diverse enough. An album can afford to sound kinda samey if the production has a lot of depth but Illmatic doesn’t. It’s simple bass/piano lines and simple drum patterns. Also “your opinion is boring” are we in 4th grade?
52441,"It is sonically diverse and what does that have to do with being boring if it wasn't. If an album is good/great then that's what it fucking is. It's not a requirement to have a sonically diverse album to sound good.  Some of the greatest albums in any genre weren't sonically diverse that doesn't take away from it sounding great. You wanted him to mix in a P-Funk sample like everybody else does.  You are some snarky wannabe who doesn't know shit about hip hop or music for that matter. 

Your opinion is boring if you don't like it don't make 4th grade shitty comments that make no sense if you don't want a 4th grade response."
52442,I think it’s boring. There’s no objective way to view it champ. The beats get stale after 4-5 songs and I don’t enjoy listening to them. The fact that you’re this upset over someone on Reddit calling Illmatic a bit boring is honestly concerning lmao
52443,"The Album was the highly anticipated debut of an incredibly talented young MC and he delivered a straight classic with not a single weak track. The production is great too as expected when you have 4 Boom Bap legends working on the production: Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, DJ Premier. That's an avengers endgame level collab. Look you can find it bland but coherence and consistency is top notch and an album should be fire from start to end which it frankly is. So I think your personal preferences shouldn't play a huge role when judging this (boom bap/90s) masterpiece (you seem to have a fable for experimental shit which is fine I love experimental stuff too).

""Objectively"" speaking it definitely is one of the best Hip Hop Albums ever made (critics, fans, rappers love it and it had a huge influence). I must partly agree though the only hard facts (indisputable) are sales and awards but I feel like the opinion of fellow rappers and critics is important too.

PS: We could dissect beats and analyse lyrics and discover a billion gems though great producers + Talented young rapper= Masterpiece"
52444,"Yeah I agree with everything you said and I’d like to reiterate that I still think it’s a great album lol. But yeah I love my experimental shit and production tends to captivate me more than lyrics in my long term views of an album, unless the lyrics are remarkable like TPAB or APOS, both of which are accompanied by some incredible beats. Guess I’m just not in love with 90’s boom bap production as a whole."
52445,The objective way is that it's considered universally as not only one of the greatest if not greatest hip hop albums of all time but one of the greatest of any genre. I read some of your other posts on hip hop and man do you suck. You don't shit. NOW THERE'S YOUR OBJECTIVITY.
52446,"“You don’t shit” beautiful champ. Thanks for taking a look at the profile too. Still is music, still isn’t objective. Sorry that I find the album a bit bland. Don’t know why you’re acting like I spit on your mother."
52447,Such a lazy argument any time someone uses overrated.
52448,"comparing it to the albums that came after it, Illmatic is outdone in many areas. The only reason 50% of people list it in their top albums of all time is so they don't piss off Nas fanboys."
52449,"What other albums that came after it? You are really on some generalizing bullshit, the reason people love it is because it's fucking good. I hate debating people like you because you are bringing nothing but bullshit to the table. No one loves an album to not piss off a fanbase. Are you fucking kidding me? Yes you are."
52450,"Tons of people put people and albums they don't like in their top 5, top 10, whatever, to not piss off fanbases. They add Jay, Wayne, Ye, Em, Rakim, whatever to appease people and not get into huge arguments. Honestly, Ny State Of Mind, The World Is Yours, It Ain't Hard To Tell, and Memory Lane are the only tracks off Illmatic that I still even listen to. Sure, Illmatic influenced many artists, it's pretty good, but GOAT album? Idk.. It certainly set a very high bar in 94', but rap has evolved a lot in the 26-27 years since then. There are artists influenced by Illmatic and Nas himself and what he did on that album, but the X factors of it (wordplay, flows, storytelling) have been outdone by now AT TIMES with artists like Eminem, Lloyd Banks, The Game, Jay who were all influenced by Nas somewhat. Those were the early adopters. No doubt that Kanye, Kendrick, Cole etc or whatever were also influenced by him. I can't really have a GOAT or GOAT album in it really, it's always evolving."
52451,"Like I agree with people being sheeps that just mindlessly repeat popular opinions but I don't get how Nas a top tier lyricist is comparable to the Game or Lloyd Bank like no hate but not any project of them is remotely close to Illmatic....a young and hungry MC delievers a classic as his debut with 4 top tier producers (Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, Large Professors). That is an avengers endgame level production collab bro."
52452,Didn't read. You are terrible and don't know what you are talking about. Goodness get lost.
52453,Didn't read?? Ok then...
52454,Facts. Influential does not mean good
52455,"Illmatic is known for being simply a tight, well-rounded hip hop album rather than an influential one."
52456,It's heavily overrated. A good bit of the reason people still talk about it is cause every rapper and their dog cite it as an influence
52457,To Pimp a Butterfly
52458,MM.. FOOD
52459,"Not necessarily all completely unskippable albums but some of my favourites:

52460,"Might be a preference, but op doomsday is far from DOOM's best album. MM FOOD is easily his best solo, and born like this is underrated"

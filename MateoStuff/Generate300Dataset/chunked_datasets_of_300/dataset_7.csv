64799,I'm curious.
64800,"It's the same comment in a lot of threads that take the form of ""where should I do blah"" or ""where should I eat"". And it gets upvotes, so there are accounts that are upvoting. Not sure why."
64801,Not sure why? May I suggest... Little Caesars on Milpas?
64802,I'm still curious.
64803,"There really isn't any exceptional restaurants if you are comparing to major metro areas like LA/SF. With that said, there are some good places.

- Lucky Penny/Les Marchands/Lark are all owned by the same group and are all very good
- Arigato for sushi. Sakana is pretty good too, but my vote goes to Arigato.
- Sama Sama with cocktails before hand at good lion is a good pairing
- Honor Bar in Montecito is really solid
- Outside of SB, but SY Kitchen is San Ynez is fantastic. Industrial Eats in Buelton is also incredible."
64804,"For Mexican food you've got plenty but it all depends what you want to eat. So you got Los Agaves, Santo Mezcal, Los Arroyos etc. If you want cheap eats you got Cucas on micheltorena, Litos take out, Cuernavaca, lilly's tacos. I've eaten  in almost every restaurant in SB (usually family owned restaurants).  But I usually dine in old town now. Red Pepper here i come! 

If any questions dm me !"
64805,"Hey, can I ask if you know any place that is ok with kids?"
64806,"Sure! Is there any specific food your group is looking for or restaurant that are good for groups and kids?  Here are some, Super Cucas, Rustys Pizza, * Cuernavaca, The Habit, On The Alley (harbor), Daves Dog on Hollister ( the cart is temporarily closed), Paesanos on the mesa and to finish it off you got blenders. 

*ps. If you to Cuernavaca order alambres/fortachon or the other three plates under that one. Its da best. And if you are getting tacos pimp them out with onions, cilantro, salsa and radish, lemons and chile carrot vinaigrette on the side. Don't leave those poor tacos naked. Gorditas de tinga or chicharron de salsa verde are to die for... ok im done. Enjoy!"
64807,Perfect response. Thank you
64808,"If you’re up for it Broad St Oyster Co is in the funk zone on weekends in front of Muni Wine. I haven’t been there yet, but I’ve heard it’s amazing. 
Little Door has good appetizers. 
Brophy’s for garlic baked clams."
64809,"Some of the best sushi I’ve had in town was at Goleta Sushi House. Awesome dumplings and beef tendon at Dumpling King, which also does great flat fish but not this time of year. IV Deli Mart does some pretty good sandwiches. Grilled Cheese Truck, which is an actual shop, has some great stuff but it’s super heavy."
64810,"The good is not great here unless you like salads, sushi and hummus."
64811,Stay out late and get After Dark Mac N Cheese from Velvet Jones. Don't get the gross bbq chicken or tater tots on it though.
64812,But why else would you go?!
64813,Uhhh lets call that the unpopular opinion. The BBQ chicken and tots take it to the next level.
64814,"Ok here goes,

Brunch at Scarlet Begonia 

Monys Tacos

Barberino

Loquita 

The Lark

Sama Sama, sometimes they are better than other times,"
64815,"I like Mony's. Nearby and also good is Shalhoob. 

I didn't see anyone post it, but somewhat underrated is taqueria El bajio. Get a torta if you go there. 

There was a recent post where someone gave a fantastic list for the santa ynez valley if you're going to make it up there. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/9566xk/restaurant_recommendations_inaround_buellton_syv/"
64816,"Shanghai for Chinese food.  
La Tapatia for Mexican food.  
The Habit for burgers.  
Blenders for smoothie."
2196,Really good. Id even go as far as saying its an affordable Bettinas...
2197,"With that comment, have to try it."
2198,So glad to see that someone did something with Paesano's. That dude that used to own the place made me not want to get food there.
2199,"I thought the pizza was decent, but their hot sauce, now that was something!"
64921,Secret Bao
64922,😮 damn that looks good. Any places that sells matcha lemonade thats not Starbucks?
64923,Maybe green table
64924,Ooh will try it out.
64925,Dune coffee!
64926,Milk and Honey is my favorite spot for drinks and small plates!
64927,"I’ve heard really good things about this place, def on the list"
64928,"Downtown: Scarlet Begonia and The Empty Bowl, At the Marina, Brophys, For in Montecito check out The Miramar"
64929,"Ooh those looks pretty damn delicious, thank you."
64930,Scarlet Begonia always has open reservations which turns me off. Will check out though
64931,Brophys is really good!
64932,Monys for Mexican food. Norton’s and South Coast for a sandwich/salad
64933,Mony's is always the right answer.
64934,"I like Benchmark Eatery, Savoy Cafe, China Pavilion, Zaytoon, Playa Azul, Carlitos."
64935,Those look good! Thank you!
64936,Mesa Verde
64937,"Oh my my, oh hell yes. I'm not a vegan, but that place is ridiculously delicious."
64938,"Thank you, will keep it close!"
64939,any chance youre vegan?
64940,I’m a vegetarian but eat eggs and dairy
64941,Ah ok. I was asking because I have yet to find a place with vegan options that truely excites me. Everything so far is just eh
64942,"Mesa Verde is fully vegan and it’s by far my favorite restaurant in SB, even though I’m not fully vegan. It was actually awarded the Bib Gourmand award from the Michelin guide (great meals for under $40) but didn’t get any stars."
64943,My two favs right now are Corazon Cocina in the public market and Sama Sama kitchen on state (Indonesian food with amazing flavors - don’t miss the traditional wings).
64944,"Corazon Cocina is SUPER good, just at a higher level than anything twice the price. The quesadilla de mercado especially, dear gawd. I'm super bummed they had to close their lower State location, but I'm glad the original in Public Market is going strong."
64945,The quesadilla de mercado is hands down the best vegetarian dish in town.
64946,The WINGS!!
64947,"Corazon is amazing, that Norteño taco is 🔥🔥🔥"
64948,Bettina and Barbareño are two other great spots.
64949,Also try out their sister restaurants Cubaneo and Barbs Pies next to the Fox Tail. Cubaneo and Barb are both owned by the same owner of Barbareño
64950,I have heard great things
64951,Loquita.
64952,+1 to that!
64953,Nikka Ramen! Definitely the best!
64954,Just went there today and got the Curry Ramen 🤤 never disappoints
64955,"Omg I would go there every day if Ramen wasn’t so calorie dense hahaha, but second this it’s great"
64956,"Molly’s for Italian, she cooks everything from scratch and you can taste it in every bite. I get the pasta bolonaise which is like heaven."
64957,Ooof now we talking. Thank you
64958,"Cristino’s bakery, only the weekends between 11-2pm they serve birria and consommé and it is heavenly. Empty bowl is spectacular. Love Mesaburger. Also there’s a smaller tapas bar that’s the sister restaurant of milk&honey, called Alcazar. It’s smaller and more laid back, and they have music some nights. Definitely go to Bettina’s."
64959,Los Agaves (De la Vina) and the Lark
64960,Need to try the Lark. Los Agaves was tasty
64961,"If you noticed that Los Agaves was a major notch above typical SoCal Mexican, then Santo Mezcal is that same notch above Los Agaves.  Same owner.  My favorite Mexican ever!"
64962,"Ooof that’s bold, will have to keep this in mind!"
64963,Best pizza in town is a small local pizzeria off Milpas called Cesarito's!
64964,Little Caesar’s on Milpas obviously
64965,"Absolutely, can’t leave without hitting up that gem 😂"
64966,The Shop for breakfast.
64967,Oliver’s
64968,Via maestro or Roy
64970,Revolver Pizza
64971,"Metropulos for sandwiches! The gyro and the pesto chicken are my favs. Close to there is Lucky Penny for pizza and Helena Bakery for pastries. I also love East Beach Tacos, and echo others on Corazon Cocina for fancy (but really, really good) Mexican. The yuzu ramen at Nikka blew my actual mind. Renaud's for pastries and brunch (the quiche is great). Idk if Third Window Brewing still does food but I've loved every iteration of their menu. 

And obvs a jaunt down the 154 to Cold Spring Tavern for Tri-tip sandwiches."
64972,You know as long as I lived there I never went to Cold Spring Taven. Gonna have to stop for sure.
64973,Go to Chase and ask for Warren the owner. The food is incredible!
64974,Who do we tell warren who sent us?
64975,And what are we supposed to say to Warren if he comes?
64976,This is a hilarious mental image
64977,On state? Good place for sure!
64978,Check out a.food.revue on Instagram.
64979,"Awesome, thank you!"
64980,"Recently discovered the Banh Mi sandwich from 4 Eggs and Pizza, one of my new favorites.  

I also enjoy the hardshell asada tacos from Monys, brussel sprouts from the Lark, either wings from Sama Sama, and BBQ chicken pizza from Yellow Belly. 

Oh and chicken chipotle club sandwich or Mexican chicken Cesar salad from South Coast Deli"
64981,"South coast is always solid. The Lark seems to be poppin, It’s made the list for sure. All of these look amazing, thank you."
64982,"A couple of breakfast spots
1. Boathouse at Hendry’s beach 
2. Recipes Bakery (Santa Barbara street and Cota)"
2262,"""Bakersfield Pizza Co. & Bar"" and ""Slice of Italy"" are both good. Mountain Mike's is also pretty decent."
2263,"Santa Barbara Pizza always gets overlooked.  It's a good, solid, cheap pizza.

You want something a bit extra?  Calzone from Rosas.  Artichoke, mushroom, garlic, basil, with marinara sauce and a side of putanesca sauce."
2264,"I wouldn’t say cheap, but it’s amazing."
2265,$10.99 carry out one topping is cheap to me.
2266,Mr fuckin big shot over here
2267,Santa Barbara's Cowboy pizza is bomb.
2268,Santa Barbara pizza is my vote.
2269,Cataldos
2270,"Cataldo’s SW, specifically."
2271,"Oildale is OG and all locations have been good in my experience!

Had it tonight as a matter of fact!🍕"
2272,x2 on the Oildale Cataldo's.
2273,Right? They put a little too much of that butter sauce for me but they’re super good.
17992,Same
58566,agreed
2276,"I don’t know how their traditional pepperoni is, but my favorite pizza of all time is the New York City Pizza from Cataldo’s. It’s a pesto sauce, with sun dried tomatoes, sausage slices, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and red onion. It is so good."
2277,Rosa’s on Columbus and Slice of Italy on F street.
2278,"am i the only one that thinks Slice of Italy isn't very good? I don't know why people keep praising this place, its pretty average pizza."
2279,Second Rosa’s.
2280,Go to LR’s in Delano :P
2281,"I know that LR's isn't in Bakersfield, but if you are willing to travel to Delano, it is seriously the best pizza I've ever eaten. It is perfect."
2282,"You can't beat Rosa's. Making pizzas there was my first job. It was already my favorite pizza and seeing how it's made just increased my love and appreciation more. The dough is made from scratch and rolled to order as fresh as can be, the cheese is shredded from the block so there's none of that plasticy additive that preshredded cheese has, and the sauce is made from scratch and let sit for a day for the flavors to blend. Toppings are almost all fresh cut as well. Really incredible shit."
2283,When did you work there?
2284,"I must be weird, but I don’t like the way anything tastes at Rosa’s."
2285,Steve’s Pizza on Rosedale is my pick
2286,Tony’s pizza.  Love their chili verde pizza.
2287,"No love for Magoo's? Might depend on which location, but the upper east side one is great. Could be because my siblings and I went to Highland with one of the sons of the owners though. California style pizza like Rusty's."
2288,"Manhood on east side is not that great in my opinion

However

The magoos on district blvd is fucking amazing. They make their wedges and pizzas different than the east side one. I live On the east side but I’d rather drive to district."
2289,"Damn, I think the ES one is damned good, so if that one is not great by comparison, the District location must be amazing. Too bad for me I have so little reason to drive so far the fuck into the sprawl, but if I ever do, I'll try and hit up that one."
2290,Magoos has my vote easily
2291,Damn no one said Pizzaville USA! Is that place still open?
2292,It’s not as good as it once was. It’s sad because it used to be really good.
2293,Yes it is and it’s a damn shame it is t at the top of the comments!
2294,"I'm so glad someone else feels the same way, my dads company always has their Xmas party there. It was the first place my parents took me out to after I came back from the hospital as a kid Haha. Safe to say I grew up going there, still love it!"
2295,Go out of town to Santa Clarita and get Toppers. Just make a pilgrimage of it.
2296,This man knows good pizza.
2297,But if you gonna go to Santa Clarita why settle for pizza when you could get kbbq
2298,The what now?
2299,Korean Barbeque. Gogi house in Santa Clarita is fantastic.
2300,Hm. Sounds intriguing.
2301,I like Me-n-Ed's. The one on Hageman and Coffee is reliable and they have a large pizza carryout deal.
2302,They have a super cheap calzone lunch combo I love.
2303,mountain mikes 👌🏻
2304,Thanks guys ended up going to Rusty’s lol but for sure I’ll eventually try these other places
63395,Wow!
2306,"Why? That place is constantly getting shut down due to health code violations.

Pizza Hut has better pizza than Rusty’s."
2307,Rusty's has the best tasting potato wedges. no joke anytime I go to Rusty's is mainly because of the wedges.
2308,I can’t argue with that. They do have some bomb wedges.
2309,Slice of Italy on Hageman and Verdugo
2310,Cubbies for sure.
2311,Bakersfield Pizza Co!
2312,Best slice
2313,"Rosa’s, Cubbies, any Rusty’s east of the 99. Pizzaville, LR’s in Delano, Pizza Barn in Kernville."
2314,LRs in Delano is worth it
2315,New Vintage Grill and cheap beer too.
2316,"My vote for Mountain Mike's.   Thick cut pepperoni,  spicy-ish sauce, great crust."
2317,Mountain Mikes
2318,Frugattis
2320,For inexpensive pizza I agree. Also the only pizza place I can find “naked” bone-in wings for my picky-ass child.

2322,"I looked for the same thing a few months ago, a headset that got very high quality sound and are also wireless, I tried a few and send them back, Then I went for the Bose one after I saw it being recommended again and again (the number 2 model on this list [https://digitalaquarius.com/best-headphones/](https://digitalaquarius.com/best-headphones/) ) and it basically changed my life, audio quality is awesome but more than anything is the noise canceling on those are insane. Also they are super comfortable on my ears! I can wear them for hours at at time and it does not bug me at all (had a sony before and couldn't wear them more then an hour without having to take a break)"
2323,Tell me you're joking.
2324,what would u recommend then?
2325,"Bose sound quality is a joke lol. Its so boring. Flat reference sounds is already boring but bose takes it next level, literally nothing pops lol. My picks are:

Sony XM4 - for best noise cancelling but boomy bassy sound

Sennheiser momentum - for fun sound but ok anc

b&w px7 - for best all-round, great sound and good anc. although sound quality dips a lot with anc on"
38042,I agree
2327,So not to Bose?
2328,\+1 on the [Bose 700](https://reddlink.tech/bose-700) headphones. Very solid.
2329,"Actually, yes you have plenty of options. 

If you want the best sounding closed back wireless headphones without ANC, the $380 (on sale) Drop THX Panda is a great choice. They use planar drivers and have THX's AAA amp technology. It has LDAC for semi-lossless streaming. If you have an iPhone LDAC does not matter, it does not support it. 

If you don't mind open back, the HiFiMan Deva for $300 is an excellent choice. I had the drop wired version, the HE-5XX and they sounded awesome except for a slight treble distortion at high volumes. This also has LDAC. 

If you wanted to go cheaper, the AKG K361BT is a good option for about $100-ish. It does not have LDAC. 

If you needed ANC, one of the best sounding options is the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless for $350 (on sale)."
2330,Having Ldac doesn't mean anything if the user has an iphone
2331,"Very true, I will add that. Thanks for pointing that out."
2332,the sennheiser momentum 3 sounds like absolute garbage and is probably the worst thing sennheiser makes (including the hd820). xm3/4 sounds wayyy better and has better anc anyway
2333,The XM4 has better ANC but the M3 sounded much better to me.
2334,Really? Because reviews say otherwise. https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-wireless
2335,"They are bass cannons,but not the good kind, the bass bleeds over and obscures other frequencies. They can be good with a proper EQ but absolutely not out of the box."
2336,"I agree, never meant to say they sound awesome just one of the better ANC headphones. Personally don't like the sound of the Sony XM3/4 too bassy and shrill for me. Kind of odd considering I like how the WF-1000XM3 sounds."
2337,"Yeah, its ANC is pretty good. Pass-through mode is trash tho."
2338,"Passive mode seems to be what a lot of headphone manufacturers fall flat on, my WF's passive mode is ""alright"" at best. 

If you wanted the *TRUE* passive experience just pick up a set of open back cans. ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ"
2339,"No, pass-through where anc gets temporarily disabled and the microphones on the unit amplify outside voices and sound and play it inside the cups."
2340,"Yea I know, I was just making a joke lol"
2341,i’ve heard them and either both pairs i heard i heard were broken or something or they just sound terrible (i’m thinking the second one because most people agree they’re bad) i’m surprised that review says something positive about them
2342,"I have a pair and they aren't the best sound. I use the Senn app to EQ the bass all the way down and they are still too bassy, but Bose and Sony sound even worse to my ear. I have yet to hear an ANC that sounds even decent, but they aren't really for audiophile applications."
2343,Ive also head many nightmare stories on connectivity
2344,"Better ANC, yes. Sounds better? Maybe if you like bass that completely veils and colors the mids, especially with the XM3s.

If that's your sound signature, go for it.

The Sennheiser M3 Wireless has punchy bass but far more detailed mids and less grainy treble than the XM3/XM4. It's not even close."
2345,What about sennhiesers HD8
2346,"I have the momentum 3, to my ears it’s not a competition at all. The XMs are all bass, the M3 actually have some range (although still elevated in the bass)"
2347,"I have the Pandas, they sound great (not life changing or anything), but I wouldnt recommend them.  The firmware is buggy as hell, and they are prone to serious issues because of a cheap bluetooth reciever& shoddy batteries.  I've been through three already since November.  Their only saving grace is customer service will send you a new one at the drop of a hat. Tney are also extremely heavy and have practically no headband padding, which makes them extremely uncomfortable if you wear them for more than an hour.  Extra padding is hit or miss because nothing sticks to them (nuggets wont work) and the headband barely extends far enough to accomodate them anyway, so if you have a big head they won't extend far enough to fit."
2348,"That's some really useful info there lol, !thanks :D"
2349,There’s also the hifiman Ananda bt
2350,Your welcome! :D
2351,sennheisers momentum true wireless 2 sound amazing for wireless earbuds.
2352,"I'd say bowers & Wilkins. They cost more than XM4 or Bose 700, but imo are worth it."
2353,I really enjoy the Grado GW100s. I find myself using them a lot more than I ever expected to.
2354,Hifiman Ananda BT. I've used them and they are amazing. They sound as good as the wired versions in my opinion.
2355,I gifted someone the Devas and got to demo them- actually really impressed by them!
2356,"Very expensive for a Bluetooth can -- $1,000. If I'm dropping that kind of dough on a can, it's going to be wired to ensure the absolute best audio quality."
2357,"I happen to have the HD 598 and I love it so much that I bought more for family members. I use it with the LG G7 (has the quad DAC) and in several ways, I like it more than some more expensive open back headphones. 


Are there any wireless headphones that are of the same quality as the HD 598? To be blunt, I sure haven't tried any that come close and I think it is going to be difficult to find good wireless headphones that come close to benchmark open back headphones. 

It may be the case that there are Bluetooth headphones that are better but it would likely be the ones that are expensive (more than the Airpods Max) as those are the ones I haven't tried. There are wireless headphones that sound good but going wireless and having ANC is going to have a negative impact on sound quality. 

ANC is also expensive tech and getting a premium Bluetooth pair of headphones with tons of features also raises the price so it is understandable why they are this price despite not offering the same sound quality (although the Airpods Max is still too much for what it offers)."
2358,"Same boat here - love the 598, want something wireless, but I also want the felt pads. I haven’t seen any good wireless headphones with felt pads."
2359,Drop Panda

2361,"i would not say that bose is top quality wireless sound, the wireless sennheiser equipment i’ve tried sounds significantly better than the bose 700 and both quiet comforts. also i wouldn’t put beats anywhere on that list."
2362,"Beats solo 3 and studio sound very good for the price. And beats solo pro sounds good full stop. ""beats = bad"" has become a meme in itself"
2363,dude look up all the frequency response graphs for al of those headphones and then compare it to sennheisers headphones that are in that price range.
2364,"Frequency response doesnt = fun to listen to. Just look at all the people recommending bose qc. The most boring headphones ive ever listened to, literally nothing pops

Funny you mention sennheiser because those have a very very v shaped response"
2365,I never said it couldn’t be fun to listen to but when it’s all wonky and unbalanced it isn’t as enjoyable imo.
2366,"Yeah but beats are not wonky and unbalanced was my point. Theyre definitely bass-heavy but not messy. The bass is tight and only slightly bleeds into the mids

Beats by monster are not the same as beats by apple. I feel like people had an impression of the monster beats and havent moved on since, even though apple significantly tidied up the beats sound"
2367,"Werent thw galaxy buds pro rated as the best sounding TWS by crinacle, to my ears they are the best ive ever heard, thats coming from a anandas user"
2368,have you tried sennheisers momentum true wireless 2?
2369,!thanks that’s a great list
2370,Are those lists from best to worst or more or less random?
2371,"If not in the top sound top four, the rest have all equivalent great sound so choosing by price should be wise."
2372,"Ah, I see. I was wondering why the Lagoons were as low is all."
2373,"Good list.  I will say that the Anker Sound Core Life Q30 are LEAGUES better than the Q20s, and can be EQed to punch way above their weight class at $80."
2374,"From this list, actually usable are   
Bose 700  
Sony WH-1000XM4  
Jabra 85h  


and that's it.  
I'd probably consider Cloud 2 wireless if you want wireless headsets as that's pretty much the best there is."
2375,"If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options. 

For built in wireless though I think the best in that price range is probably a hifiman deva (or the bt version of the Ananda if you want to jump up in price)"
2376,">If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options. 

How would that work when there is a 1m+ long cable? I mean where does that go, how do you ""convert"" I guess a wired to a wireless?"
2377,"I use a small velcro cable tie to wrap it up and then the btr5 either goes in my pocket or it has a clip so I can just clip it on my shirt or even the headband when I don't care about looking like a middle aged dad with a tiny cell phone holster. Def works best with headphones that have replaceable cables so you can get a shorter cable. 

The deva/ananda has a much cleaner setup and also works as a wired headphone"
2378,Can confirm the btr5 with my hifiman he4xx is FAR better than any Bluetooth headphones ive heard. I usually just run the cable under my shirt and stick it in my pocket. As far as “conversion” you just make sure the battery is charged and the device is connected to your source and you plug your headphones in. Thats it. The btr5 comes with a little case with a clip on it so you can also clip it to a belt or your pants or whatever
2379,"If you have a nice set of IEMs or headphones with a replaceable cable, you can invest in a good short cable. I prefer the radsone es100 to the btr5, it can power up to my Audeze LCD-2s with ease"
2380,"As an alternative, if your headphones have an removable cable you can buy short one, or have one made for you new or mod your original one. Combine that with Qudelix 5K which is about half the weight(weighs around 25 grams if i recall correctly) and has better features than btr5, and you can clip it on the headband. Wont win you any fashion shows, but you get great sq from it, very functional and plenty alternative uses for the 5k."
2381,"Best Bluetooth set I have heard is AirPods Max, but they really are only an option if you are already on iOS.

Supposedly the 800$ bang and olufsen h95 are top notch as well."
2382,"Audeze Penrose X for a “headset”.

Planar magnetic drivers. Great sound. Works over 2.4GHz Wireless USB or Bluetooth 5.0. Detachable microphone tuned in collaboration with Shure. Works on every platform.

Downside is just limited range distance for 2.4GHz usage, but I set up my dongle such that it shouldn’t be an issue if I need to move from my desk to the nearby kitchen and stay connected."
2383,"I love my Sony MX1000mk2s I wore them at work for 2 years, 10 hour shifts and listen on the side and they are still champs."
2384,MH751/752 is the best option for headsets
2385,"Sennhesier Momentum 3, Dali IO6 are just 2 that are very good, but there are many more out there."
2386,"I truly recommend the bose qc35ii , they sound great for most audiophiles and in my opinion they are equally or better sounding than the senheisser , I think bose has much better neutral sound overall in my opinion , also they are the most comfortable  ( one of most important things when listening through headphones ) also the anc is stellar and class leading , I can't recomend the sony wh-1000xm3 because I didn't tried them but they're also amazing , I personally have the bose qc35ii and sony wf-1000xm3 , bose - brand new replacement coming soon , sony wf-1000xm3 - repair coming soon , the sony wf-1000xm3 are the best earbuds I ever used , they have top notch anc and impressive sound for their price , they're truly worth it as well , a companion for your high-end headphones"
2387,I'm surprised no one mentioned the Audeze Mobius yet.
2388,mostly because they are expensive compared to other headphones and mobius are decent but are nowhere near as good as the competition.
2389,Sony xm4s
2390,It depends on how you like the sound. XM4 have a heavy bass.
2391,I like the sound profile at least in LDAC mode
2393,HIFIMAN Ananda is for sure. It really sounds better and gives some quality bass compared to the wired Arya [wired arya](https://intoptrend.com/best-headphones-reddit-2021/).
2394,"175-U is progs shit because I've never heard of that name before, Senny budget options in general are garbage.

You could get fiio btr3 adapter to make any pair of headphones wireless, but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.

I'd personally just get akg k371BT, because anything better than that is a waste of money imo. Bose qc35 if you need ANC."
2395,"The 175-U is ~$300, does that count as budget still?

>but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.

Yeah I'm aware of that, but I'm just getting annoyed by cables lol. And since I switched to an HD 598 I don't really wanna go back to a general gaming headset quality, cause it's such a downgrade when listening to music

But either way, !thanks for the suggestions:D"
2396,"They didnt do 4.40/4.50bt right nor did they do their refresh of 350bt 450bt right, their IEM's are horrendous so I suppose that 175-U from 2014 will be even worse considering how wireless technology ages quickly."
2397,"> You could get fiio btr3 adapter to make any pair of headphones wireless, but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.

Would this be a good option for gaming or is the delay worse than having a RF wireless headset/headphones"
2398,"Sony MDR-V6. They've been the broadcasting standards for years, super tight bass. Will last forever, at least until the foam ear surrounds will distenigrate, but are available aftermarket. Best headphones you can get hand's down for < $100. Can't recommend enough. I've had cans costing 100's more (Senns, AKGs, etc). While all great headphone they all have their plus and minuses but you love the V6. Check amazon, as they are getting difficult to find elsewhere. You can thank me later ;) after you've seen them, carefully watch sporting event's, you'll notice almost everyone using them, great response, fairly flat, fit on the ear/ slightly over the ear w/40mm drivers, etc. https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-mdrv6/review/ , https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6, you get the gist. There's now various other variations, you can't go wrong with them."
2399,"I haven't tried these, but Sony audio is wildly underrated."
2401,"[Audio Technica ATH-M50x](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/99aff89488ddd6b1/)

Over ear professional studio monitors. 

[Here they are being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZweyIKNwX4) in Paramores music video."
2402,"Came here to say this, super comfortable, great sound."
25954,Agree
2404,"I bought these and love how they sound, but I find them incredibly uncomfortable, I can't wear them for more than an hour :("
2405,$150 as a starter?
2406,"Well he did ask audiophiles. That's cheep for audiophiles, great headphones though."
2407,"Oh, you sweet summer child..."
2408,"There are headphones that go well into the thousands, some even in five-figure territory.  

Personally (and I say this as an audio engineer) I think it just becomes a wank after a certain point. The differences taper off quickly, and most people are going to be listening on shitty earbuds anyway. That's not to say you can't hear any quality difference, or that you shouldn't work just as hard on your mix - but it's easy to think anything sounds amazing with good enough speakers.  

It's kind of like wine. You can buy a shitty bottle for $10, a decent one for $25, or a really nice one for $100. You can also buy a super nice one for a couple grand - but most people aren't going to notice a huge difference between the $100 and the $2000 bottle."
2409,I think the point where it no longer becomes worth spending more on headphones is $200 or so. After that diminishing returns take effect and improvements are just so minor most people won't notice
2410,"I know, it's the same in almost any market.

My point was more that someone who has not spent more than $20 on headphones is unlikely to see the point in spending 7 times that."
2411,The M40x are almost as good and are something like $100 (I paid £70 in UK)
2412,"I got mine for US$70. Very happy with them, excellent quality."
2413,"> Audio Technica ATH-M50x

This absolutely. Really well made, super sturdy and comfy. Great sound for the price. I utterly love mine. Use them for work (video editing), for commuting, at home hooked up to Hifi. Unless you are going to invest big money in proper audiophile stuff you really can't go wrong with these."
2414,"I have these and I like them, but they haven't blown me away or anything"
2415,I use these they blew me away for the price
2416,"I'm listening to music with these on the bus as we speak. As a DJ, these are amazing headphones and extremely comfortable for long periods of use. Sometimes DJing for 6 hours takes a toll. I bought the limited edition blue and beige ones for $200 CAD, That's a steal tbh. Seinheisers are a good alternative but the M50X's have done me well"
2417,I'd say ATH M30Xs. The 50s are like 120-150$. The m30x are a great pair to start with because they are around 70$
2418,My theatre used to use those as our monitors. Solid audio quality
2419,Agree. The best in my opinion.
2422,Another vote for the DT880. A step up from the 770's in price though and quality.
2423,"I love my DT990 pro.

But i think its not all about headphones. If you want to use them on a PC you definitley need a sound card or desk amp"
2424,Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro - best Headphones I've ever owned. Like wearing plushy clouds over your ears that make everything you thought sounded good sound at least 10 times better.
2425,"I'm not kidding, Grado 60

Get started 

http://gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series

They're open-ear so you should only use them at home and if your mom asks if you're damaging your hearing, tell her to get lost.

http://gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series/item/2-sr60e

I wish I had my Grado 80's but my dog chewed all the earmuffs off and then my girlfriend kicked me out."
2426,"I came here to say this. I did a little freelance work for a friend who insisted that I charged too little, and gave me a pair of 60s as a tip. I thought I knew ""good sound,"" and immediately after using the Grados, realized I had no idea, now I can't go back. 10/10."
2427,"These were my starters. Agreed. I got some Audio Technicas for the office, but still prefer these."
2428,">I wish I had my Grado 80's but my dog chewed all the earmuffs off and then my girlfriend kicked me out. 

lol what"
2429,Oh well that's what happened. I'm playing music on Apple EarBuds right now instead.
2430,How did you know I live with my mom
2431,"nah, but when I first bought some Grado's I did live with my mom and she thought I was blasting my ears out but open-air headphones are different and unusual"
2432,It's so beautiful!
2433,I love the sound but they're not very comfortable for long periods of time.
2434,Oh? That surprises me. What do you find comfortable instead? Asking purely for me cause maybe I'm uncomfortable and I don't know it.
2435,"I was using a pair of Sennheiser PC 360's and it's like being hugged around the heady by a teddy bear.  Recently picked up a pair of Audiotechnica ATH-M70x's and that's more like a leather pillow on each ear.  The Grado's stock foam cushions were too abrasive, and if it was humid at all my ears just became a swamp.  That'll probably be true of the M70x's, too, but they're still easier on the ears overall.  (Better sound, too, but also like 4x more expensive than Grados)"
2436,nah.
2437,Sony MDR-7506. Workhorse of the industry.
2438,Exactly. Any Sony MDR-V6 variant just kick ass. See my comments above
2439,Read your comment and couldn't agree more. Beats anything in it's price range and even some more expensive pairs. All around excellent set of cans.
2440,"I use these every day during work and I adore them. I started with Audio Technica headphones but my giant melon was too big for them. The Sony pair fits great, sounds awesome. Pretty cheap too! 

I'm not really an audiophile though, just a programmer who loves listening to music while working."
2441,Sennheiser HD280's! I make music professionally. I also use them when I workout. The sound is crystal clear. My only complaint is the ear muffs are a bit heavy during hot weather.
2442,I just commented suggesting these too! Had my first pair for 7 years and would have used them longer if I knew I could fix them before I ordered the same model again. I don't know how you can use them for workouts but for just about anything else they're A+.
2443,"Absolutely, and the best part is you can usually find a decent pair of Sennheiser headphones for <$50. I've gotten two different pairs on Amazon, and often you can find older models (or last years) at a very good price."
2444,"Sennheiser Hd 558. Every couple months theyre discounted to $70-$80 on amazon, get them then."
2445,"They're currently on discount at Best Buy.

2446,"Just picked up a pair there, awesome headphones. Thanks for the heads up!"
2447,"Sennheiser HD 280 pro

 I had my first pair for 7 years. I got the same exact model when those broke down, as in the aux plug got bent. Little did I know before I ordered my new pair that they were actually designed to be fixed if need be. They are super durable, comfortable, great natural outside noise insulator (I rarely have volume set to over 30%), they're like x-ray vision in video games like CS:GO, friends have reported hearing things in songs they've never heard before. They're studio headphones so you don't get added bass (which I prefer) and the cable can be ornery but they are excellent and sound like $250+ phones for $100. They last and last and last!"
2448,Don't know much about over the ear but Sennheiser was the best set of quality earbuds I've ever had. Asymmetrical cord was weird tho.
2449,"Sony MDR-7506. Cheaper than the ATH-M50x, and just as good, if not better."
2450,AKG K-240s are a great pair of headphones that won't break the bank.
2451,240's are also great performing can for the money. +1
2452,AKG Y50
2453,Got the Y50BTs for free with my phone. Love them!
2454,Audio Technica ATH-MSR7GM...Current headphone for about two years now.  Love em!
2455,I've had them too for half a year now. Absolutely worth the investment.
2456,"Something by Audio Technica. They are very high quality headphones for a reasonable price. If you are buying a cheaper pair, get OPEN headphones. They will benefit from the airflow better. Only buy closed if you are worried about sound getting out, or you are buying professional quality headphones."
2457,Professional quality? Almost all high-level headphones are open past $300. Really I can only think of the Fostex TH-X00 as closed above that.
2458,Go on r/headphones and ask them
2459,"/r/headphones: Senn HD650 + Schiit stack, easily over 500$"

They completely cover the ear and provide for some really chunky and uninterrupted grooves to reach the ear holes."
2461,"Philips SHL3060BK. Very solid, good price."
2462,for earbuds - V-moda zincs.
2463,"I've been a JVC advocate for a few years now. 

I'm on my 4th pair now and they have on a consistent basis been high quality and long lasting... and comfortable to wear. 

my current set is a JVC HA-RX900. Theyre a little big but theyre immensely comfy, are pretty well soundproofed and the quality is better than anything else I've ever owned. 

£60. my previous JVC pairs came closer to £10-£20 range, but they were pretty nice too... these ones are by far the best ive had though"
2464,"This is a hard question to answer without knowing what you listen to, what you're looking for out of a headphone (comfort? Isolation? Portability? Doesn't matter as long as it sounds good?) and what your budget is. Plus, once you start getting near the $200 range for headphones you may run into a pair that needs an amp to really shine.  It gets expensive and a bit overwhelming real quick."
2465,Koss porta pro ---- 30$ and sounds better than most 150$ headphones. Those who really know headphones will have a set of these.
2466,"V-moda m100 crossfades, but get the bigger ear cushions."
2467,What would be the best say Bluetooth earbuds for working out?
2468,"I like Bose. Good response, clear sound, and a noise canceling system that can kill most any annoying sound. Expensive though. 

Sony makes a really nice headphone, I had NC7s and NC8s for a while, and some headphones I liked but forgot the model number of. As I'm typing this, I'm using some MDR-ZX110NCs. No complaints.

Beats are overpriced, overrated, and anything else can most likely outperform it.

When I used to volunteer as a sound designer, we had a set of some Audio Technicas that I never had any problems with, whether I was running mic check or just using 100k worth of audio equipment to play Blink-182.

 But seriously, a good set of Sony headphones will serve you well for audiophile use. Audio engineering, see this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6sjh0r/audiophiles_of_reddit_what_headphones_would_you/dld9hbt/

I'n almost sure that's what we used, and they worked amazingly."

2479,"Just don't spend more that $200. I wouldn't even spend that much. Your just paying for the name at that point, not a better product."
2480,That is 100% not true.  You get diminishing returns at high dollars for sure but I can guarantee you the $400 headphones I own are a better product than anything in the sub $200 range.  I know because I own two pair in that range.
2481,Audionoob
2482,"I dont know if they are country wide or just local to my state, but I have Skullcandy ear buds. They are phenomenal. The pair I usually buy are around 25 bucks(depending), sound amazing and can take a beating. I have washed them, dunked them in water and Mt Dew, put them through some touch conditions. I dont think I have ever had a pair short out on me and the only time they have ever broken was when they got caught in my door and snapped. I seriously cant praise them enough. The best part is, they come with a manufactures warranty that if something does happen to them, you can send them in and exchange them. At least that is how they were. I have never had to, so I dont know if they do it anymore or not."
2483,"If you're wondering why you're downvoted to oblivion, the question regarded headphones and not earbuds, and come on... skullcandy is commercial hogwash, there's so many earbuds I could recommend in the 20-30 price range that would crush pretty much anything skullcandy, but if you actually want some *good* earbuds you'd have to go beyond at least 40-50 bucks minimum. Whatever you do, unless you're loaded, don't buy earbuds for more than 60$, it's just never worth it, I've wasted too much money on that to just have them ripped apart by accident, and as soon I'm home it's back to beyerdynamic headphones."

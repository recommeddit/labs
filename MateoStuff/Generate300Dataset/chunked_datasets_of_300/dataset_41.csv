13226,"~$250-300 if I remember right, depending on where you get it. We love ours!"
13227,"The absolute best shower gift I got was from a couple of girlfriends of mine. They got me a gift certificate for a massage/soak at a local wellness center, and they both came over to the house, watched the baby, and gave my house a good cleaning. It was amazing. 17 years later, and that's the gift I remember the most. If she doesn't have anyone that she trusts with the baby, you can watch her/him while your wife goes out, and hire a housecleaner to come in for a couple of hours. If my husband did that for me, even today, as a full-time student and mom of teenagers and tweens, I would be over the moon!"
13228,"Wow! I hope my boyfriend has an attitude like that when we have kids :) good on ya!
I agree a spa say would be awesome, provided that she was completely comfortable with whoever was looking after bubs as it could be difficult for her to fully relax. 
Ask her what she needs from you! Better to get a loving neck rub every night than one expensive gesture IMO!"
13229,"Get a babysitter and take her out for the evening. I asked my wife and she said if she could get a brake from our 3 LOs, she would like to do something adults only with me like get dressed up a little, dinner and a museum or the theatre. She doesn't really like the spa idea or shopping much. We recently moved so she doesn't have many friends who are close; otherwise, maybe an outing with girlfriends would be nice. Long story short--she probably would just love a little time to reconnect with the non-mommy side of herself. Good luck."
13230,"Something that has nothing to do with babies or motherhood, unless it's something you know she's been hankering after for a while.

Otherwise, something to make her feel beautiful and like a woman rather than a mom would be good. A trip to a salon to have her hair cut/dyed/styled, her brows done, and a manicure is always nice. A shopping trip to her favourite store, so she can get herself some new clothes (she's probably not quite the same shape/size as her pre-kid body!), would likely also go over well. Sign her up for a class, something in the evenings when you'll be home to watch the baby - is there something she's always wanted to learn, like art or music or dance? It'd be good for her to get out of the house around other adults once a week."
13231,"When my daughter was that age, I spent the day basically nursing and not much else. I would have appreciated an e-reader loaded with books to give me something to do while I nursed. I was not the type of mom who could have gone several hours for a spa day at 3 months without missing my baby like mad."
13232,"I support all the ideas of ""time away!"" I'd also suggest a gift cert to a local store they enjoy shopping at/malls/etc and maybe with their favorite drink/coffee/ etc. Just stuff they like to do alone that they can't get the opportunity.

OR give them a day (without the money) alone and you get the house scrubbed professionally.  Like ""I got you this Coffee and a day alone and don't come home until 4pm because theres another surprise"""
13233,"I love my kindle. I also love being able to take a bathroom break alone. Maybe you could get her a kindle, and a night of her own. I enjoy a long hot bath with candles and reading to unwind. 

Also, body massages are good. Body massages and chocolate are better. Body massages, chocolate, and booze is even better."
13234,"Spa, massage, time.
Nothing else comes close."
13235,"Massage every few months, audible.com gift cards, girls night, a date planned for just you two where you arrange the sitter (just make sure it's someone mom-approved)."
13236,"Full spa afternoon.  Mannie, Peddie and Massage."
13237,When our daughter was 2.5 months I bought my wife a tablet so she could easily check email and watch Netflix while nursing.  I got her the Nexus 7 which is small enough to hold in one hand.  She loves it.
13238,"I think the best thing you can do is to truly treat her job like a real job (it is one), and split the work 50/50 when you get home. No trinket is really going to communicate that you appreciate her if you treat your work like the ""real job"" and her job as a 24/hour responsibility she's never allowed to escape."
13239,Time alone or time with her friends.
13240,"I would suggest a camera. A nice one. SO said that he wanted to get me one as a ""push present"" but I know its not in the budget right now. I will, however, be waiting patiently for this camera. The one I have is pretty decent, but the pictures I could take with an even nicer one: so appealing. Or, if she already has a camera, maybe a photo printer? I have one that I absolutely love, but it only came with enough ink and paper to print five pictures, so take that into account should you go that route."
13241,A new vacuum cleaner
13242,"My favorite gift since having our babies has been my ipad. I love having something light and easy to hold with one hand, and I was happy to be able to read books and magazines easily while rocking the baby at night."
13243,"I looked through all these, and as a mother of a soon to be 3 month old, I wouldn't wqnt any of these.  Not because they're not good gifts, but just because they're not good gifts for me.

Good gifts for me?  Silhouette machine or stand mixer because those are tools that would make my hobbies easier and more fun.

Becoming a mom didn't cause my interests and hobbies to change.  You know your wife better than a bunch of strangers.  Get her something for HER."
13244,"Does she have hobbies outside of maintaining the home related stuff (cooking and that sort of thing)?  like knitting, sewing, other crafts?  

If she does either upgrade her equipment  AND/OR set aside money for a regular sitter to come to the home so she can designate an hour or so once or twice a week to her craft.

OR 

bring in a cleaning service with the money. 

OR

Both."
13245,SAHD here. A nice pair of headphones were the best present I received. Our baby monitor lights up so I just keep it in my field of view and fire up the TV or computer to relax during nap time. Works great even with baby sleeping on me.
13246,"I'm a sahm of a two year old and a 9 month old. Here's my under $500 wish list:


Maid service.

Hire a sitter or call in the grandmas, book a room, booze me up and bang me silly.

A day to myself. Hand me the keys and the cash and tell me to have a nice time. 


Actually, that's it for me, really."
13247,"something I suggested before on a different post.  As a SAHM the thing I miss out on the most is the little notes and cards and scribbled drawings that my kids give to their dad.  I know that the baby's too young to even make a mess, but find a sweet card and include the baby's foot print as a signature.  Over time you'll gather a small collection of these little treasures, and while she gets to be with the kid all the time, her treasure box will be lacking in comparison."
13248,"As a stay at home mom....a day to do what I want without interruption. For my birthday, from my mother, I got a voucher for a full day and night of babysitting. This was by far the best gift I got. But this is me. It depends on if she could be away from here baby for that long. I got that voucher when my babe has 6 months old and I used it. hoe this helps!"
13249,I love what my friend did. She would take me out once a month. As a new mom it was heavenly.
13250,"These would make a nice gift, http://newpcgadgets.com/products/smartphone_stand/"
13251,A personal spa day
13252,Time with their children.
13253,There are tons of gift ideas at r/gifts. You should check them out :)
13254,"My mum mentioned she water-skied a couple times when she was younger, so I bought her and me lessons at a nearby lake. It was great fun but I think the thing that mattered the most to her was that we were doing something together.

So something she hasn't done in years that you can share together."
13255,"I like that idea, now to think of something in a week..."
13256,My mom is super into true crime and loves books so I got her a new release. I think gifts that are personal and show you know what they are like are more memorable and appreciated. My brother got my mom a spa day gift card once and my mom barely even gets her haircut let alone treats herself to a spa. So just try to think of things you know your mom likes to do but maybe wouldn’t buy herself
13257,Take her out for dinner with the family (but avoid actually doing it on the day itself to miss the crowds).
13258,A new vibrator.
13259,Pay for them to have a romantic evening together
13260,"This.

Movie tickets and a dinner cert. from Costco!"
13261,"Spending your time with them. Plan to take them on a trip (holiday if you're loaded, day trip somewhere if you're not!) I can't buy my parents anything they need but I know they like spending time with me. As a parent myself the moments I'm happiest are when the little ones choose to be with me!"
13262,This is a good idea.  Or just a dinner on your tab.
13263,Giftrocket.com - customized online gift certificates.  You can make a suggestion in the email as to where to spend the money - perfect for dinner at their favorite special occasions place.
13264,"An experience. Ask them if there's something they've always wanted to do but never had the opportunity. Then figure out how to make it happen.

I did this for my father's 70th birthday. He always wanted to fly a plane, so I surprised him with 1 hour flying lesson. He LOVED it.


You'll be a hero. If it's expensive try to make it a group gift by including other family members. They will also thank you. Good luck!"
13265,Doing a group gift is a great idea! My siblings all pitched in for a nice grill for my father and he absolutely loved it.
13267,"Go to your local municipal airport and ask if they have instructors that do that sort of thing. its very fun, and I would absolutely recommend it."
13269,"My dad owns a plane, so I've never paid for it. you'll typically have to pay for gas (maybe $50+) and the instructor ($25~). An obvious general rule is the smaller the plane, the less gas it uses. A Cessna 150 or 152 would be very small options, I would recommend a [Cessna_172 or similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172#See_also), as they are four-seaters."
13270,"I'm a pretty handy male, and my Dad is getting up there in age so, I always ask them if there's any projects they'd like done around the house. My mother especially loves this. These tasks have included painting, cleaning, yard work, some minor remodeling, hanging items up is a big one, and help decorating. They are always elated 100% of the time, and as a bonus they usually get to spend some additional with me. All parties walk away happy."
13271,You're an awesome son. I hope to teach my kids these skills as well.
13272,"Assorted massage oils and scented candles. They might not ""need"" something but at least they can do something."
13273,Might also result in siblings in 9 months.
13274,"Grandchildren, well that's what mine keep asking for... Gona keep trying with my wifu"
13275,"My brother died at a young age, 25. While inconclusive we think it was a seizure due to epilepsy, long story but he had it as a child.

My cousin gave my parents a gift one year. A donation to the Epilepsy Foundation in my brothers name. The were very, very touched by the sentiment.

Maybe think something along those lines."
13276,"That is very kind of your cousin, and I'm so sorry about your brother. I lost one of my best friends to epilepsy when we were 15."
13277,"I recently recommended to my girlfriend that she get her parents a ""gift basket"" of sorts. Gourmet treats, drink mixes, self-made baking mixes, and the like."
13278,"If you and any other children still live at home, find a way to give them regular alone time, no questions asked. Don't make me explain that."
13279,Planning a home invasion.
13280,Time off.
13281,"Favorite foods that they may not buy for themselves.  
Pictures (or, if you want to get fancy, an internet connected picture frame that you can update for them.)    
Experiences with you or with each other.  Take them somewhere nice or send them on a trip."
13282,I get my mother cooking classes for the two of us and take my father out to dinner.   Essentially shared time in something they enjoy doing.
13283,"Find your favorite photo of them and you when you were a child and get a nice canvas print of it.  They probably have the best photos, so you'll have to be sneaky to get it from them.

If they're sciency and you've got cash, there's a National Geographic kit for $150 that traces your ancestry all the way back to Africa.  You have to pick the maternal or paternal line.  Your mom or dad swabs their cheek then mails it back in, and NatGeo provides a detailed report on your family's lineage.  I got this for my mom for Mother's day to trace our maternal line.  (Bonus on this one:  It's a present for you too) -- https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com

Are you crafty or artistic?  I'm short on cash this year, so I found a place that sells reclaimed wood from barns that were torn down.  I'm going to paint something for my parents to hang in their house.  They have everything they need, so I figured a hand-painted piece of old barn wood would matter more to them than some crap they already have."
13284,"Just got my dad to agree to no gifts this year.  I could not be happier about it.  There are no kids in our family; adults exchanging Christmas gifts just seems asinine.  We'll hang out, eat a big meal, talk, and watch our dogs play together."
13285,"Take them out to a nice dinner. It is a mix of spending time with them, eating good food, and the payment as the gift."
13286,A big meal!
13287,Donate money in their name to a cause they enjoy.  It'll let them know you care about what they think and they get the satisfaction of knowing that their name is on something they care about.
13288,"have a photo done in a cute frame. or get a basket, one of their favorite movies, put in popcorn, a couple of sodas, and some candy. or maybe a gift card to a restraunt. good luck an happy holidays."
13289,A grandkid.
13290,Steal something from their house and then make sure they notice it missing. Then gift it back to them saying its new!
13291,"A current photo of yourself, and any significant other/children you have. Sounds conceited, but once you move out we can't drag you off for a family portrait any more and have to wait until you give us one."

13296,"If we're talking quality and features exclusively, then yes, MS Office is the champion. That does change however when we talk about other issues, like vendor lock-in, licensing, privacy, etc.

Here's my personal comparison between MS Office and LibreOffice. I use both.

First: Both LibreOffice and MS Office offer a **very comprehensive feature set**. But MS Office is a bit more comprehensive, especially when it comes to features for power users. In Excel you have more chart types available and more options to combine different chart types. You get PowerPivot and PowerQuery, which do not really exist in LibreOffice Calc.

LibreOffice generally lacks some of the ""modern"" features, like cloud integration, good touchscreen support (and inking with a pen) or live co-editing documents between multiple authors.

LibreOffice doesn't include a mail client / calendar but offers a decent vector graphics module, which MS Office lacks.

MS Office performs better in my experience. It seems to me, that LibreOffice is single threaded for the most part. It doesn't fully use, what modern multi-core processors have to offer. Consequently, I find LibreOffice a tad slower most of the time, especially when working with large documents.

LibreOffice GUI is old-fashioned. Not necessarily a bad thing. If you liked MS Office before they introduced the ""Ribbon"" you'll feel right at home ;-). The UI is also visibly buggy, especially on high (4K) screen resolutions.

Generally, MS Office seems more robust. I have LibreOffice crash on me from time to time. It's not extreme, but it happens more frequently than MS Office.

LibreOffice scores points when it comes to licensing, privacy and politics. First, it's free and opensource. Quite simply an unmatched value proposition. It's the only free and comprehensive office suite, that is available on all relevant desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Licensing, price and supported platforms can be relevant if you collaborate with peers, e.g. working on a study project and you don't want to force peers to use a proprietary/paid product.

It doesn't have telemetry and its non-existent cloud-integration can be seen as a privacy-feature. It uses a free format for it's documents, which reduces vendor lock-in, although in practice, the only softwares that really support that format well, are derivatives of LibreOffice. At least those derivatives can exist."
13297,Richard Stallman please re-login.
13298,"With Excel: you definitely want to stick to the industry standard.   
When you go outside the norm, it might be great for certain reasons or applications but overall in terms of support (being able to simply google how to do X or Y will be the easiest in excel over anything else).  


It just makes your life easier to stick to industry-standard software unless you have a specific reason not to."
13299,"I agree.  ""Best"" is so subjective too.  Best spreadsheet program for people that have used Excel their entire life?  Definitely Excel.  Switching would be a disaster for productivity.

Best spreadsheet program for a room full of young students with chromebooks?  Probably not Excel."
13300,It’s always Excel.
13301,"Google Sheets is the only likely competitor.

LibreOffice Calc is free, but I wouldn’t call it better."
13302,"Google sheets is to Excel what a bicycle is to a car.

It will get the most basic job done, but for any even remotely complex use case it just can’t compete"
13304,"Excel lets you use SQL. It is the older MS Access type SQL, but still. And if you're using a large enough dataset to really need to use SQL, you'd probably be better off using an actual database application."
13305,I'm always torn on that as a spreadsheet feature. SQL's very powerful but should you not really be using an actual database to store and query your data?
13306,"I am by no means a power user of either sheets or excel, but the one feature i use daily with sheets that excel does not have (to my knowledge) is the ability to copy and paste cells using the drag down while filtered and not have it copy the data into the cells that are hidden."
13307,Google sheets allow you to do searchable drop down menu natively and handles images a lot simpler than Excel.
13308,"> and handles images a lot simpler than Excel.

I think that phrase might be the absolute perfect distillation of the different audiences"
13309,It's more like sheets handles images at all. You can store images in cells and recall them via a formula in another cell. Hard to do that in Excel without vba or some sort of camera trick.
13310,"He means it’s mostly inconsequential as there are very few valid reasons to have images in excel sheets (I know, you do it and you think it’s useful, more power to you. It’s still irrelevant in a spreadsheet software)"
13311,"I don't use Sheets. I just know it's a functional difference and could be something that's beneficial to someone out there. Just like how I don't use most of the formulas available in Excel, but having the option is what makes Excel so strong."
13312,"I'm not exactly sure what you mean by searchable drop down menu, but I can't remember the last time I had to add an image to excel."
13313,"Let's say you have a drop down menu for people with titles in front of their names: Doctor Who, Doctor Yu, Doctor Shu, Cowboy Ox, Cowboy Lox, and Cowboy Nocs. 

In Excel, you can click on the dropdown menu and pick the name you want. Click on Doctor Who and get Doctor Who.

Google sheets is the same, but also allows you to type into the field and the drop down menu will update base on your entry. Doctor W will get Doctor Who, but ox will get you Cowboy Ox and Cowboy Lox. So you can search through the dropdown menu without having to do anything more than filling out the data validation.

Video: https://youtu.be/n2DxXffRxBM?t=82"
13314,"There is a search function in Excel when filtering and it allows you to add your selected search items to the filter. 

https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/234/filter_search_ok.png"
13315,"Not what I mean. With Data Validation, you can create a drop down menu. Sheets allows you to search the drop down menu which may be useful if your drop down menu is very long."
13316,"Oh sorry, I misunderstood what you meant."
13317,"To expand on my metaphor, because people keep replying with niche features that Sheets has - A bicycle can also take a ride on a forest trail which your car can't, the car is still the more powerful tool for most use cases."
13318,"Integration with GSheets is just better, the thing is designed to be the middle point between all your processes. And to do that it lets you use a modified version of javascript, and I'd rather use that than VBA every time. The main drawback is that Google Sheets performs bad with large datasets (>50k rows).

API integration, mail reporting, custom input-only forms (with Google Forms or with raw Apps Script and your own html file + css) are a common thing in Google Sheets. If these things aren't complex enough for you, well, I don't know what is.

All of those can technically be done in Excel, but let's be real, have you even tried to connect to a RESP API with VBA? Its documentation is 80% written for C# developers (oh and have fun parsing json files). Meanwhile the Google Apps Script documentation is crystal clear and if something isn't there, you just add a library that does the heavy lifting for you.

Yes, Excel can handle 700k rows of index matches in a fraction of a second, but for a developer and as a integration tool, as a middleground between your processes, as a interconnected *spreadsheet* Google Sheets is better."
13319,"When you have 10.000+ rows, Google Sheets is severely impacted in its performance for me ."
13320,Yeah gsheets performance is ass. I only use it for small things.
13321,"Yes, sheets performs poorly for high end power users. I find it more usually for smaller datasets, automation with GSuite integration, and for collaborative tracking."
13322,Isnt google sheets the online version of excel? I thought they were identical
13323,IMO it's the best program in the world period
13324,I hear PotSpreadsheet is really good
13325,You cheeky lad!
13326,"I prefer Google Sheets. Workng across teams is much much easier, and it has nearly all functions Excel has, but with the added capability of easy integration to BigQuery, Data Studio, etc."
13327,"Google sheets collaboration is just miles ahead of  MS 365.

It's the thing I miss the most in excel."
13328,"Yeah, Excel 365 collaboration is no comparison against Google Sheets. With Sheets, you can lock tabs to specific users. I found in Excel 365, there's certain things you cannot do when multiple people have the doc open like refresh a query. Also, you cannot refresh a query with Excel 365 through a browser.

Obviously there's pros and cons of each. I just migrated a shared doc from Sheets to Excel 365 because I needed more advanced functions available in Excel, but at the loss of the better collaboration features, which I ended up replacing with a combination of Microsoft Forms and Microsoft Power Automate."
13329,Even in the stripped down Excel Online?
13330,Can I do the things in google spreadsheets that I do in VBA?
13331,Mostly yes. There are scripts that are based on the Google Apps Script language (basically Javascript) so you can automate your tasks.
13332,"the biggest shortcoming is that VBA has lots of APIs to interact with other programs (e.g. SAP), Google apps script has none of that."
13333,You can actually even automate your tasks by recording them as macros and editing the VBA code. I found it super useful when I didn't know VBA.
13334,In google spreadsheets?
13335,"No, sorry, that was confusing. I meant in Excel."
13336,"OK, thank you."
13337,I like Google sheets but sadly I can’t use vlookup or any formulas I think across different files like with excel so Excel wins for me.
13338,"You can! You use a nested formula called importrange, but it certainly works, as I've done it."
13339,You should also check out Airtable and Coda
13340,But its so slow and lags! It feels like using excel through a VR headet. Thats what all online google docs feel like
13341,I don't have that issue. You might need to check your internet connection.
13342,"When you consider self service BI aspect of Excel (Power Query, PowerPivot using DAX etc). Yeah, as spreadsheet software, it's about the only option. With it's general availability and wide spread use, there are many free tools that extends it's ability as well (OpenSolver, Analysis Tool pack, etc).

Excluding that part, Google Sheet is tad behind, but not by much. They were ahead in some aspects, before introduction of new array behavior by MS in Office 365.

And I love the cloud integration part of Office 365 suites. With single API (Graph) that allows you to connect and interact with various parts of ecosystem (SharePoint, Teams, Planner, Excel  etc)"
13343,"Sticking to the industry standard has huge advantages in terms of ensuring compatibility and finding more documentation when you have a problem.

&#x200B;

I have never looked into other spreadsheet programs, but my guess is I'd be surprised if another software were considerably better at something.

&#x200B;

Why exactly are you asking this? Curiosity? If you are wondering whether another software would make you more productive, well, the greatest boost in productivity probably comes from knowing when to use a spreadsheet and when not, ie when the task warrants the use of a proper database and/or a proper language (e.g. Python), often used together.

&#x200B;

In general, the more a task is small and one-off, the easier it is to just do it in Excel, but the more its scope grows, the related data grow, how business-critical it is, etc, then you are typically better off steering clear of Excel."
13344,Is Lotus 1-2-3 still a thing?
13345,I thought that was the rebranded libre office
13346,"Not for 20 years.. It hasn't been relevant since before my college days, and I never saw it in the work place, not even as a legacy app for some old project."
13347,"I was talking to a colleague the other day about back in the day when our office still used Lotus 1-2-3 (I didn't work here then, I'm old but not that old), and that prompted me to look it up -- turns out (according to wikipedia) IBM didn't officially retire the brand till 2013!"
13348,"It's probably the most generally applicable.  

Programs like miniTab and SPSS are specifically tailored toward utilization of statistical data sets, so you have some general spreadsheet functionality, but everything else is geared toward that use case."
13349,"My honest opinion is that it absolutely is, but there is so much room for improvement.

There are a lot of ridiculous aspects to Excel, a lot of missing functionality and bad UX choices. There are major obstacles for a lot of use cases.

That said, it's still better than any competitor. I get annoyed when I run into something frustrating in Excel, but I wouldn't even be able to get *to* those points in any competitor. There are a handful of things Sheets will do better, yes, but far more things Excel will do better than Sheets.

The real lesson, I think, is that there is room for a serious Excel competitor. And I think we need one, because here we are in 2020 and you *still* can't change Excel's number autoconversion behavior, or have macros work without clearing the undo stack."
13350,What are some of the things youd improve?
13351,"I mentioned my big ones: options for default number format handling, and allowing VBA to work with the undo stack. I would also want a much better implementation for event handling in VBA, asynchronous stuff in VBA, multithreaded VBA...Also, for ontime calls not to break if excel is in edit mode or the user opens/closes a file, etc.

Macro source being an object, not a string (application.caller).

A GUI ribbon XML editor would be great. More flexible options for it too (not everything the native ribbon has is available to user-defined ones).

Compatibility patches for old versions so I don't have to worry about formulas not working on a file I send out.

Being able to specify number of worksheets in a workbook created in VBA. (I have to run loops every time to delete excess sheets that might be present.)

Having worksheet.copy return a worksheet object (it's insane that it doesn't!).

Being able to copy workbook theme to a new workbook object so it doesn't just have the application default. This can be done now, and I do it, but it's *extremely* awkward and involves saving and loading a temporary theme file from disk!

Etc., etc. That's just what I can think of off the top of my head.

Edit: more reliable repaint functions would be good too, for cases where application.screenupdating = false.

Edit 2: having min and max functions in VBA outside of workbookfunction; they could just be aliases but goddamn that's awkward for a basic programming function.

Edit 3: having the VBE not default to showing a form object if present instead of whatever code module I was actually working in."
13352,Are Excel developers aware of these things? Is there a way you can tell them? Or is Excel not going to change any time soon?
13353,"A lot of them have been in the suggestions pile for *years*, constantly ignored. They'd rather implement some new obscure internet data source thing that makes for pretty pictures when they're presenting new features.

Also, Microsoft considers VBA to be dead, and yet they do not have a replacement."
13354,Sorry :(
13355,"I'm just glad that no one in this thread mentioned numbers.

Libreoffice has its place, as does sheets. No idea why anyone would willingly choose numbers."
13356,yes.
13357,"It’s probably the best program ever. I’m being hyperbolic, but Excel alone is worth the 365 Subscription. It can be as basic or complex as you want it to be."
13358,What do you find are the advantages of PotPlayer?
13359,"Speed of opening, speed of navigating through video, hotkey customisation for keyboard and mouse, choosing where to drag and what clicking the screen does, no weird lags or glitches that VLC is plagued with. Mostly speed though. VLC is very slow and especially slow when  scrubbing through a video and speeding up a video is not accurate, like it says x2 but the video is clearly not x2."
13360,I think you need to specify the operating system. Excel for Windows is by far the best. Excel for Mac is hot garbage.
13361,Yeah windows
13362,"For video playback, the K-Lite Codec pack and Windows Media Player Classic are where's it at. (Note: This is for ""power users"". There are many installation options.)"
13363,Does it have a super fast boot time and unlimited hotkey keyboard/mouse customisation like PotPlayer?
13364,"I doubt anything loads more quickly.

I don't know about ""unlimited"" hotkeys, but you can [customize them](https://imgur.com/a/jpYco1V).

(It's a custom version that comes with the codec pack, called MPC-HC.)"
13365,Hows the video buffering? Does it lag when you drag the scroll bar or go to another time? PotPlayer is instant and seamless buffering
13366,"MPC-HC is lightweight and performs well. But if PotPlayer performs well-enough for you, then why even consider switching? Besides, performance is really dependent upon the renderer you use, and both PotPlayer and MPC-HC can use just about any. (The best current renderer is, arguably, madVR.)"
13367,there is an excel out there with better graphics... eveonline.
13368,"Industry. Standard.

That is far more important than being the best for professional clout.  Excel is the industry standard."
13369,"Well, it is now.

It wasn't always.  Before it was discontinued, Lotus 123 was better by an astounding margin."
13370,"No, Microsoft just got in early. ~~You could probably make a better one in something like Matlab or even entirely from scratch.~~

I change my mind you can definitely make one better."
13372,You is referred generally to people not necessarily to OP. Making a database program is entirely doable and running scripts just requires the ability to run a programming language inside the program. Excel's vba language is incredibly weak as far as I know and can be easily exceeded by something like matlab.
13374,"Mathematically? Yes. Excel has horrible mathematics. queries aren't particularly hard either. I'm mostly around scientific computing so while it's out of the skillset of most people, it's definitely doable. It's just not done because runtime computations aren't efficient, even Matlab is only for prototyping actual programs are C/Fortran."
13375,That's a lot of words and no action or proof.
13376,"Oh, because I'm supposed to write a spreadsheet program that exceeds Excel? Even though there is no real use for it as runtime execution is a significant performance hit. 

Everything, I've said is established fact. 

FYI this script will defeat anything you can run in Excel. (Matrix-Matrix product, performed linearly to avoid excessive indexing calls). Nearly beats Fortran Matmul (in fact it does beat it at low optimizations, but loses at -O6), so yes it's super-fast.  

    fn multiply(&self, other: &Self)-> Matrix<f64>
     {
     let mut z = Matrix::<f64>{data: vec![], dimen: (self.dimen.0,other.dimen.1)};
       for k in 0..self.dimen.0{
       for i in 0..other.dimen.1{
       let mut k:f64 =0.0;
       for j in 0..self.dimen.1{
        
        k+=self.data[j+ (k*self.dimen.1)] * other.data[j*other.dimen.1+i];
          }
                z.data.push(k);
           }
           }
           z
           }
     }

If you can beat this in Excel, I will eat my shit (You can't it's impossible). 

Excel is computationally worthless. There are better ways to implement it."
13377,"This is one of the most commercially unaware, common-sense lacking, devoid of perspective opinions I have ever read online, in 20 years of using the internet. My eyes have seen incoherent posts, statistical deception, non-popperian arguments, ungrammatical posts, insane conspiracy theories and logical fallacies. OP's post is coherent and grammatical, yet is orders of magnitude more silly than anything else I have ever read. Perhaps it is BECAUSE he is an above average IQ individual that unironically believes the words he just typed out."
13378,"...Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
13380,I think he's doing it on purpose. He has a post saying Elon Musk is a moron. While Elon is a controversial figure no one would call him a moron. OP is just a provocateur edgelord
13381,"Elon Musk is not the genius that he is portrayed as. His ideas are what you get from an engineering undergrad. The actual intelligent people are not known outside of there specific field. (If you know the name Shannon, you know exactly what I mean)."
13382,My claims primarily seem off-base due to lack of familiarity with the topic. Most of my posts/comments are about mathematics/cryptography/physics and (theorectical) computer science. So it's understandable to not get my points if you don't have enough background knowledge to know the basis.
13384,"Was I supposed to write an essay for this? Because I can totally write up a computational analysis of a spreadsheet program. (Excel is closed source as I'm sure you know, so any analysis would be far to speculative).

Why should i bother though? Proving myself to people on this website doesn't even matter. I made an accurate observation, that people here are outraged about. And the only thing you can say is ""But I haven't seen you do it!"". Also r/libreoffice is totally a thing (although it's also shit). 

A bunch of children. . ."
13385,Why do you think one can make one better?
13386,"One can clearly make a more versatile and efficient spreadsheet language. 

Since Excel and most of the other knock-offs came out there have been major improvements in computational science. Nowadays we have languages like Julia which use JIT compilation (it's like python (or VBA if you are more familiar with that) except it produces fast machine code after the initial compilation). Something like a Rust/C core program and using Julia for the actual embedded language would be a vast speed improvement.

Now if you were using the spreadsheet for mathematics that's where the real improvement would be. You could ""easily"" (as in technically feasible) build a full computer algebra system in the spreadsheet. Which is why I referenced using Matlab for spreadsheets since it's actually conceptually close (and a language i assumed would be well-known here) and would basically just need an gui interface for a spreadsheet. 

The reason why nobody does it is because Excel works just well enough for business (even a lot of businesses resort to specialized software after a certain scale). That's it. I don't get how that's a unpopular opinion here."
13387,"I too am a power excel user, I've found that the best way is to use vm fusion / bootcamp and use the windows version of excel....

Pretty bad that I can simultaneously run excel for mac and excel through a virtual machine and the the vm one is a million times better...."
13388,"I'm fairly new to the VM options, do you have to boot into your VM combo or can you have it as a window open alongside other Mac apps (ala Parallels)"
13389,"Paralles for Mac *is* virtualization. You can pay for it or use VirtualBox for a free alternative. It will be slightly more difficult to setup and seamless mode is not as good but it's more than enough to just run Excel in a VM.

Depending on your Mac's hardware any kind of virtualization might be a but sluggish though, especially with Windows guests. 4GB RAM total should be the absolute minimum and that's already pushing it."
13390,"Edit due to misread:
When you use a vm, it runs alongside your other windows as it's own window usually.

Also, look into trying boot camp. It's a bit more complex to set up, but will let you store a windows machine alongside your Mac OS, so you can just boot into it at startup"
13391,"I recommend VirtualBox, it's totally free and the only requirement is that you have your (legitimate) Windows CD to install the OS onto the VM."
13392,"No other spreadsheet software is equal to Excel for Windows. I'm a Mac-using CPA so I'd love to be proven wrong, but in my experience the only thing that comes close is Excel for Mac, and as you've found it is not quite the same as Excel for Windows. I have Windows installed on my MBP via Boot Camp solely for gaming and Excel. That may not be the most elegant solution but it's the only approach that I can recommend for your needs."
13393,Have you tried anything like Parallels to emulate a Windows environment and run Excel from there?
13394,"Good point - I've only dabbled with Parallels before switching back to Boot Camp because I didn't think it handled games that well. But for programs like Excel that don't need 3D graphics, it may be just fine. It's probably worth a shot, using a virtual machine instead of rebooting every time you need Excel would take away a lot of the hassle."
13395,"You can use Parallels or Fusion to load up windows from your Boot Camp partition. The best of both worlds! (Too bad MS can't get its shit together and make Excel for OS X as good as the Windows version.) There's even a mode where windows don't have to be encapsulated by the Windows desktop, so it looks like it's just running in the OS X environment."
13396,"I did wine with excel and it was alright (kinda slow and i never remembered where it would save my files but it worked just fine)

but then again that is on linux (and parallels might have a better solution for where it saves the files)"
13397,"I work with large spreadsheets as well. I don't like the concept of ""power users"" for Microsoft Excel; the truth is that there are very few people who are true power users (I.e. have the ability to write macros and create code to support programming through Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications). 

I had similar problems using Microsoft Excel for Mac until I increased my RAM to 8 GB.  Microsoft Excel for Mac is very unwieldy code in order to provide support for legacy features and functionality including and especially Visual Basic for Applications.

Microsoft really screwed Mac users by deprecating Visual Basic for Applications integration with Microsoft excel for Mac.  

In the case of macros I have used AppleScript to re-create some of the functionality of Visual Basic for Applications integrated with Microsoft Excel for Mac.  

In the case of pivot tables, Apple Numbers offers table categories which is not quite the same but can reproduce similar functionality without the overhead of running Microsoft Jet database engine.

The only real issue with Apple Numbers is a much smaller user base resulting in a much smaller community to offer off-the-shelf macros and scripts. The truth is that few people have really explored the capabilities of macros and scripts and Apple Numbers regardless of what they might have you believe."
13398,"When I say Power User, I mean that I regularly make 200+ character formulas and the spreadsheet can take 30 seconds to recalculate.  I think Power User is a useful way to describe the difference between someone who manually enters the numbers for a table (and doesn't use much of Excel's functionality) and a person who has multiple indirect lookups and 1000+ line worksheets.  The first person is not going to see much of a difference between Excel for Mac and Windows."
13399,"I understand perfectly well what you mean, we disagree on the definition of ""power user"" which is why I don't like the term ""power user.""  The commonly accepted definition for a Microsoft Excel ""power user"" includes the ability to design macros."
13400,"If you know how to write macros you are better off creating an SQL database. 

VBA is awful."
61839,Agreed.
13402,"I know how to program and:

a) VBA is awful

b) Macro-enabled documents are a security hazard

c) If you get a bit creative, you can do many amazing things in Excel while avoiding macros entirely"
13404,Since it seems that no one has mentioned it I will just draw your attention to Numbers which is made by Apple. I have it but I rarely use it so I do not know how well it replaces Excel but it might be worth checking out.
13405,"run Windows/Office in a VM, it's the only way for power users

that said why are you making power user spreadsheets at home on your Mac, do you really need to Monte Carlo your personal budget"
13406,:)  It is mostly when I am doing stuff for work or grad school and need to use my home computer (Mac).
13407,"I run W7 in a VMWare VM just for Office 2013 at all times, it's pretty painless assuming you have 8GB of RAM and integrates seamlessly with their Unity technology"
13408,"I usually use excel if I just need to take a very quick look at the data. But if there is any chance that I may do some operation (basic stats, filtering, sorting, etc) I like to load it into R and use Rstudio's data explorer for it. If you're more comfortable with python, pandas with jupyternotebook or spyder should also do."
13409,"You also could use libreoffice or openoffice. Especially for xlsx files for example. Othetwise if its  a csv file, use R, python and if you like an editor."
13410,"And you could use the ""less -S"" command in a terminal"
13411,Google Sheets doesn't do the dates thing. It doesn't do as much fancy stuff as Excel but you don't need most of it anyway. It actually has a bunch of formula stuff that Excel doesn't have which I find very useful. And it has the advantage of being easy to share and collaborate with.
13412,"This might be a bit obtuse to the question, but why not use something like csvtk or pipe it to column.

For eg:

`csvtk pretty -r -s"","" < input.csv `

should give you an right-aligned columnar table in the terminal.

Other-wise, just:

`cat file | column -t`

But yeah, other than this I tend to use Libreoffice :)"
13413,"Google sheets is good because, it is collaborative and highly scriptable with google app scripts (clasp) even though I hate Javascript, I did use it. I wish I could use something like Python in google sheet, it would be so much easier and better. Also, if google sheets had an cli, then bash could have been used much more easily to manipulate the data."
13414,"Excel for organizing things, keeping track of freezers, etc. 

R (or Python) for doing actual data work."
13415,"Google Sheets or LibreOffice

I hate Microsoft"
13416,"I find LibreOffice to be a great package, but I believe there’s some questions about the data collection policy of the parent company"
13417,"If you have a Mac/iOS device Numbers is a suitable option. I think there is an iCloud (web based) implementation too, but I know nothing about it and have generally been unimpressed with web based spreadsheets.

That said, I personally think LibreOffice is much more usable and closer to Excel and integrates well with the rest of the office products, and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux.

Calligra is also an open KDE option that runs in Linux/BSD."

The idea is that many people know how to use spreadsheets and very simple HTML, but don't know how to maintain static web pages on a server.  This provides a bridge for such people."
13433,"That is an exceeding beautiful idea. I'm going to read the code later because I want to see how you've implemented that, but my python experience is limited (Java developer by trade, though I've used python a bit, mostly extending other people's code). Can the page template automatically output new fields, or is it a rigid table structure that maps one-to-one?"
13434,"I'm sure the idea could be reimplemented using Google Java API.  Please let me know if you decide to fork the project.  I know people who would use a Java version.  I haven't had time to do it myself.

The whole thing is very extensible.  I have plans to someday enable templates in other spreadsheets, but I haven't have time nor a pressing need for it yet.  The current template does use that table structure, but you can always add columns.  You can also change the template to suit your individual needs.  I tried to keep the example simple enough for people to understand how it works."

13438,"There are a limited number of queries that you can make per day, but yes.  It is essentially acting like a database."
13439,I realise you cannot do complex queries isn't it say have a parent child relationship and use it like a table

13466,LibreOffice then
13467,"I used to use libre. It is the closest thing to how excel looked before all the huge button bullshit.  
  
But I am now solidly on the google sheets hype train. Sheets is the most user friendly of excel, libre, open office, etc (i have tried them all) and is just as powerful. Accessing them through the cloud is also a huge advantage as you can just log in from any computer. BUT I recommend turning on offline functionality. This will make calculations and updating not be such a pain."
13468,"> Sheets ... is just as powerful.

It's not. It's really, really not. Now, this might not matter if you only do fairly simple things--they both cover a certain subset of functionality.

But I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I get paid to do in Sheets."
13469,"Not sarcasm. Authentic curiosity, because i am aware there is functionality that excel has that the others don't; what are some of those examples? (And in my case for what I do there has been no difference, but it is fairly simple math, just handling very BIG data.)"

13490,[CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index) is a good resource for finding author copies of papers.
13491,http://booksc.org/
13492,"Also, apart from all the advice given here, if you know the area and the author(s) of the paper, you can look at their websites (University or research organization websites) and they usually have their papers available for download."
13493,"Aside from the other suggestions, sometime you can request a pre-print through http://researchgate.net/."
13494,I had no idea. This is great to know. Universally true for all journals?
13495,"Yes with certain restrictions. Many (most?) journals hold copyright to the typeset papers and authors cannot legally distribute them widely. But, the final ""copy"" that is not typeset but that has gone through peer review can be distributed as one wishes.

​

More importantly - most of the recent papers are freely available to the public through Pubmed (for certain fields) after certain amount of time has passed - in most cases 6 - 12 months.  


Edit: added ""for certain fields"" after a commented pointed this out below."
13496,"> most of the recent papers are freely available to the public through Pubmed after certain amount of time has passed

Depending on the field, of course."
13497,You mean I'm not going to find papers on kalman filters and black holes dynamics on pubmed?

13500,lol something about using this guide against the bigoted motivations it was intended for is really funny to me.
13501,"I've found Sci-hub less effective these days, but yeah they're still around. Also consider using [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) for searching OA content. Industry people think much of what used to be paywalled will be open access as a standard. Publishers would make money on APC (what the author has to pay to publish) and selling bibliometric data.   


&#x200B;"
13502,How much time? Recent papers available after a certain amount of time is pretty vague.
13503,"> cannot legally distribute them widely

My favorite part of writing my thesis was needing to get permission from journals to use *my own papers*. One journal has it written explicitly that you only need to copy the agreement, the other 2 I had to email asking them to use my own words. Then I  had to thank each journal for that permission....felt awful."
13504,">  to use *my own paper*

Tell me about it! Not to mention, I had to pay for color figures for some of my papers \*and\* ask them permission to include the papers in my thesis."
13505,"People are starting to publish the figures separately before the paper itself, under a CC-BY license. They then cite the figures in the paper to not have them covered by the journal's license agreement."
13507,It's also a gold mine for computer science papers. Pretty much every paper I've sought out was found on arXiv.
13508,"Pubmed is a godsend, even if it is moderately annoying from an IT perspective sometimes."
13509,Can you explain? It is hosted on *.gov domain. Why is it a problem?
13510,"You may be confusing PubMed and PubMed Central. PMC does have the accepted version of manuscripts (not copyedited or typeset) available depending on the funding body (NIH for example) but there is usually a 12 month embargo before they are accessible as you said.

Many would also be surprised how many errors are caught during copyediting/typesetting. In addition, some authors blatantly reprint figures from other sources without obtaining permission from the original copyright holder or get proper patient release forms for their patients in figures, which are just some of the additional functions having a publisher serves."
13512,Could still donate that cash!
13513,Hi its me your professor
13514,"Just get it on Sci-hub for free, like every academic I know."
13515,"Agreed on getting them through sci-hub first to read them in full, and check that the paper’s actually what you need . but then if you need them for something other than satisfying your curiosity it may be better to then try and contact the people who wrote it and get stuff from a more ‘official’ source, and maybe get an eventual contact, specially if both of you work in related stuff."
13516,"Nah, as a student and as a researcher, it's impossible to ask every author whose work you cite or reference in your stuff. I'd spend all of my time contacting people instead of actually doing real work. Everybody I've talked to [in academia] is fine with sci-hub and uses it themselves. In the end, the authors of this stuff don't care where you get their paper from, as long as it's cited formally and appropriately. It does far more for the author than wasting their time contacting them personally or getting it from the publisher - imagine if everybody across the globe asked individual authors for a copy of their paper, who has the time for that?"
13518,"If you don't get a response from the senior author (usually the email that is provided), try emailing the first author who is usually a Postdoc or senior PhD student and are more likely to respond. You can usually find their email address by looking up the lab's website."
13519,The founder of reddit died for this.

13521,"For Math/Physics we usually post our pre-prints on a free hosting website call Arxiv.. so for every article you see on the journal, just find its Arxiv equivalence.

Those those don't post on Arxiv are usually obnoxious pure mathematicians that have no friends... so you're not missing much, morally."
13522,Don't care that I've seen this a dozen times on Reddit. I'm upvoting because more people need to know about it!
13523,I've actually contacted maybe 20 to 25 article authors and only two have responded and sent me their paper. I don't think this is quite as ubiquitous as this person makes it seem...
13524,"Many academics are not well-versed in what they are and are not allowed to do, via copyright law. Matters are further complicated by the fact that each journal's contract is a bit different in its restrictions. I imagine two different things are happening for you. 1) Authors do not want to share for fear of reprimand for overextending copyright law. 2) Many academic authors just don't have time to add on ""e-mailing the general public"" to their list of already long duties that include teaching, research, and service commitments."
13525,"That's totally fine, I just wanted to indicate that people shouldn't really expect to get the articles, which is what the post is about."
13526,"Absolutely - my post is not a criticism, just an extension =o)

I should further add that you should check to see if they have a ResearchGate profile, as many researchers post their work on those profiles. ResearchGate is like the LinkedIn of Research, but with extended functionality."
13527,"I would lean towards 2 being the main reason. You may think it’s fairly straightforward but when you have 40 emails from class students 9 from your graduate students, your own research and 4 grants that need to be written and awarded to continue your program and you haven’t made your slides for class next week yet, general public emails tend to go unanswered. I say as I browse reddit at the gym."
13528,"Its probobly more #2 then #1. A lot of profs are extreemly busy. Many filter out certain emails. Others have way too much email backlog to read them.

Source: Engineering PhD student"
13529,The place most people contact me requesting a copy of my papers is on researchgate and I don't check that regularly. I do eventually send them a copy but it can be weeks later and I always wonder if they still care.
13530,People are busy and often do not respond to random strangers.
13531,This. They almost never reply.
13532,"Scientists tend to get a lot of e-mails from cranks (though how bad it is depends on the field - you really have to feel for climate scientists), so you have to watch that you don't say anything that might set off their ""crank"" instinct. Use an institutional e-mail account if you have one, don't start the e-mail by describing your new theory, keep the message short and simple.

Even then, some people are just busy, don't use e-mail well, have strict filters, or don't know they're allowed to share pre-prints."
13533,"It's the usual issue - authors won't know they can do this until more readers contact them about it which they won't do because authors aren't responding. 

But there's another problem - journals actually have a purpose, which is to give credibility to papers. That's not true of the Hollywood Upstairs Journal of Medicine, but certainly of countless others. 

The idea of systematic peer review (not just ""my antivaxx buddy read this and said it sounded good) and reputation is important. On the other hand, clearly we have a problem of boring studies not being published and broken peer review. 

It's all a bit of a clusterfuck."
13534,"Not only that, but peer review is proving to be utterly useless in picking out which studies are reproducible, and which ones are fundamentally broken from a methodology standpoint.  For some reason, betting markets are just as good or better than peer review and journal editors at being able to pick which studies will be able to be reproduced."
13535,I’ve always wondered if this actually worked. Good to know.
13536,"Based on my experiences in graduate school, I would 100% chalk this up to professors being busy and missing the emails. I often have to email faculty I work with three or four times before they see the email and respond. It's nothing personal, they're just so insanely busy they don't see everything the first (or second) time it comes.

Besides, there's always SciHub if you really need a paper urgently."
13537,Don't bother. Just use sci-hub.
13538,"Sounds about right.

Thats about the same rate that my committee responded to emails."
13539,"Whenever I’m contacting about papers, I hit up every author to hedge my bets. 

I also find I get a better reply rate when I describe whatever my project is. 

A couple researchers compiled a list of where all federal workers were by zip codes, and they did this by jumping through a lot of FOIA hoops. I was surprised they were willing to provide the information, but it helped close a project in a day that would’ve taken a few weeks."

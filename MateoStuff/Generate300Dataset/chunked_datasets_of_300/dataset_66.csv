21035,"No problem! Melodic hardcore type punk is my absolute favorite for the gym (and in general). The only problem is I start finger drumming between sets and lose track of time. 

Fast Forward Eats the Tape is probably one of my favorite albums ever. Also coincidentally the first punk band I ever watched live (opening for Bad Religion almost 15 years ago)."
21036,"you'd take metropole over oh, calcutta? c'mon man."
21037,"Actually I just put Metropole there because it has such a nice flow and is the latest one which I am really enyoing at the moment :)
I love all of their albums though. 15 years of great music!"

21043,We must be soul mates
21044,Lately I've just been pressing play on Yeezus and having a great workout. only 2 songs aren't high energy.
21045,Black skinhead is my deadlift song.
21046,"""Blood on the leaves"" timing max weight with beat drop."
21047,These are awesome... I added all but three of these to my playlist. Thanks for the info :)
21048,Which 3 arent up to midnightcandy standards?
21049,Not a big Snoop Dogg fan... I'm not sure about Nas either. I can't remember the third
21050,"...don't like Nas? That's like saying ""oh I like rock but I'm not so sure about the Stones"".  

edit: although Ether is not my number one choice for a Nas song."
21051,"I'm all about the folk-metal and viking-metal at the mo.

I like listening to [Ensiferum](http://youtu.be/cO4QqaoFuso) on the cross-trainer and pretending I am striding across the artic tundra under the moonlight, or listening to [Amon Amarth](http://youtu.be/5jHxVFQQ0j0) doing seated cable rows and pretending I'm pulling the oar on a longship, headed out to plunder.

Maybe add in some Korpiklaani and Eluveitie and you're pretty much sorted."
21052,Twilight of the Thunder God by Amon Amarth is my go-to pump up song currently
21053,"I can't listen to Amon Amarth while I lift, it makes we wanna take a bar, crash some skulls and conquer the women from the zumba room."
21054,And hear their lamentations?
21055,The folks at Planet Fitness may have something to say about pillaging...
21056,"Pillaging, crushing enemies and the lamentation of their women WILL set of the lunk alarm."
21057,It says so right in the contract. NO PILLAGING.
21058,Aye that whole album is great!
21059,Any other recommendations?
21060,"Well, I really like Eluveitie but that might not be to everyone's tastes. They have hurdy-gurdy solos. But Everything Remains As It Never Was is worth checking out if you've never heard them before.

I've really only been rekindling my love of metal recently due to Spotify, so I am not very up to date, and I like loads of stuff that is probably not well respected :)

From  folk-metal perspective, as I say check out:

* Korpiklaani - Manala is a great album to start with
* Ensiferum - Unsung Heroes and From Afar would be worth trying
* Eluveitie - Everything Remains As It Never Was, Slania, Helvetios
* Finntroll
* Skalmold - saw them support Finntroll, were very good
* Tyr - didn't flick my switches but a lot of people like them
* Turisas - ditto
* Dimmu Borgir - ditto


For general metal I really got into Trivium, who I gather a lot of people dislike, but I genuinely think Shogun is a fucking brilliant album, and In Waves is great too.

Mastodon obviously, Crack the Skye in particular.

Septicflesh - The Great Mass was very good.

I really like Skindred, have done for years, one of the best live bands ever. You will either love them or hate them though.

Machine Head - I had Burn Your Eyes on cassette back in the mid 90s, was very happy to rediscover them! The Blackening and Unto the Locust I really enjoyed.

Killswitch Engage is always good really good gym music obviously.

Any suggestions for me? Especially on the folky/vikingy side?"
21061,Wintersun.
21062,"They look familiar - think I gave them a try the other day but I'll have another go, ta :)"
21063,They were formed by the original Ensiferum singer.  It's not really Folky like Ensiferum is but I think they are the best melodic death metal band out there.  Check out Starchild from their debut album and Sons of Winter and Stars from Time I.  Amazing stuff.  If those songs don't do it for you...
21064,"Check out Equilibrium, might be a bit black for a lot of tastes, but at least Blut im auge is fucking catchy!"
21065,"Good username :) And I'll give them a whirl, cheers."
21066,I got a suggestion for you.  This one has been a favorite of mine for awhile - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h0SswsOsEo&list=FLxN_O70ekJGTNv3VnF78oSg&index=21
21067,What's the band/track? I can't listen to it at the mo but will check it out later.
21068,"The song is Lux Aeterna.  This particular mix is called ""the two towers version"" according to the youtube description."
21069,"haha I came to post about Amon Amarth. Love working out to the Twilight of the Thunder Gods album! Managed to see them live recently, such an awesome show!

Ensiferum is awesome too!

+/u/dogetipbot 100 doge verify"
21070,Have you heard [Heidevolk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=reOLeLX0Q9U#t=16)? They're a favorite of mine along with Korpiklaani.
21071,I don't think I have - I'll check them out thanks!
21072,"Unless you're already listening to them I would certainly recommend you to give Månegarm, Thyrfing, Svartsot, Einherjer, Heljareyga, Trollfest and Alestorm a listen :)"
21073,"Awesome thank you. I've tried Manegarm, but maybe need to give them another try.

I really want to like Alestorm but imo their singer is awful :("
21074,"Really? Damn, I think they're one of the best in the genre with Thyrfing and Amon Amarth. 

I think Alestorm is kind of an acquired taste, it does however fit when you binge on whisky, rum, ale and stout lol."
21075,Eluveitie and Korpiklaani for the win!
21076,"Hey man, you should definitely give a listen to [Finsterforst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65NoVkdhFk8#t=1m10s) and [Moonsorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rra22NPcBI) - they're the two most badass folk/viking bands that I know of, and some of my favourite workout music as well."
21077,I would suggest [Imperanon Blade.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4zv0qHeHVM)
21078,"Oooh I'm liking that, cheers!"
21079,"Usually lifting or on the treadmill.

21080,Good call on the TNGHT. I find trap makes for pretty good gym music.
21081,Further is one of my favorite albums. Horse power is a little weak but the rest is stellar

21096,Anytime i hear The offspring I immediately want to start lifting heavy shit.
21097,"I'm a big Kanye fan [Blood on the Leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9os5qNv_RI) is perfect for a warm up. It starts off slow and then when the beat hits, I start lifting. I love that beat."
21098,"This has been by ""walk into the gym"" song for the last 2 weeks"
21099,"I don't usually like Kanye, but this song is pretty good."
21100,"As I lay dying - through struggle

Pantera - walk

Bury your dead - house of brick

Hatebreed - I will be heard

Earth Crisis - firestorm"
21101,As I Lay Dying-  94 Hours is crucial as well
21102,Pantera - I'm Broken is also good to get into the mood.
21103,"I always listen to Harder Than You Think by Public Enemy when I start my warmup. Great song to get hyped up to. After that I don't pay too much attention, just have a playlist on random with Kanye West, Jay Z, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris, The Prodigy, some dubstep, some 80s thrash metal, some other rap."
21104,"anything with gun sounds and 808 drums get me pumped. juicy j, waka flocka, meek mill for sure."
21105,"I prefer no music myself. I did listen to music before but I've started to appreciate silence so I can have 100% focus on the lifting. 

I think that every gym should stop playing fucking music so people can have silence by default or use their own music devices if they want music. Of course it's never going to happen but it would sure be better. Some people prefer to have a meditation approch to weightlifting, and then the music is probably going to be distracting."
21106,"I guess this makes sense, because if you wanted to listen to music, you should have brought it with you. I must be too easily distracted because I get bored if I don't have my music with me."
21108,I don't work out as hard at home as I do when I'm at the gym. I only work out at home if there's a bad storm out or the gym is closed.
21109,"Definitely a good thing for you, enjoy it. I'm no anti-music person, don't get me wrong - it's a pretty big part of my life, it's just that I find it hard to concentrate on more than one thing at once, and music so easily pulls me in so it ruins what I'm doing at that moment."
21110,"Hey, whatever works for you man, but there's actual some good evidence that listening to music can improve performance:

http://www.seriouspowerlifting.com/4231/articles/listening-to-music-increases-athletic-performance

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/why-exercise-workout-music-playlist_n_4173931.html"
21111,"> I think that every gym should stop playing fucking music  
  
I used to workout at home, and would listen to baseball or hockey games on the radio. Now that I workout in a public gym, I have to bring music to drown out whatever random Muzak station is on, or the bleating of CNN/Fox anchors."
21112,"From the perspective of someone usually working out in a silent powerlifting gym, I have tried the silence thing and it sometimes works excellent to almost sort of take a break from music, but I have to say ever since I got a fixed warranty pair of my earbuds back I much prefer it with music again. Which is weird because the gym has a first come first serve boombox I can aux any device into but I still prefer the odd serenity of not sharing my music.. And if I'm high it makes me blaze through an otherwise possibly tedious workout on a day I don't like or something. 
Anyway, it's an interesting concept"
21113,Doesn't working out high make you more prone to injury?
21114,"I haven't had problems with that so I guess I can't really comment on it, in my experience pot can decrease perception of pain which can definitely make you lift harder than usual and yes, possibly hurt yourself too."
21115,Yes sir. I think the reason they do it is so that potential new members see the gym as  being a high energy / fun place. But I agree. I've had to double my volume on my device when I'm at the gym to block out their music.
21116,"I go to PF, it's my music or theirs:("
21117,"I'm a big fan of Tech N9ne for workout music. ""Riot Maker"", ""Welcome to the Midwest"", ""Caribou Lou"", ""The Beast"", and ""Bout Ta Bubble"" are all great pumpup songs.

Edit: I'm also going to throw ""Rock Star"" by N.E.R.D. in there."
21118,"Also, speaking from experience, Caribou Lou will indeed get you fucked up beyond belief. Can't even taste the alcohol."
21119,Can't confirm. Blacked out that night.

You're welcome :)"
21125,"I'm all about the extreme genres of metal while lifting, currently some of the songs that fires me the fuck up for PR's are:

Mjød - Kvelertak

Sultans of satan - Kvelertak

Image of Time - In Vain

Sonne - Caliban

Flight of a dying sun - Purified in blood

Mot grav - Purified in blood

Desolation - Lamb of god

Purania - Destrage

King me - Lamb of God

Disappear - Before the Dawn

The Hunt - Wolfheart

Wayout - Destrage

Evig Vandrar - Kvelertak"
21126,"I just discovered Destrage! Man, their new album is a trip. 

Nothing like some heavy breakdowns to make me wanna pull the shit out of a barbell."
21127,"I fucking love Destrage, so happy to finally see them getting some recognition, after their first two albums pretty much just flew under the radar for most of the metal world. I strongly suggest checking out their two old albums as well, both are excellent."
21128,Caliban has helped me to set a couple PR's throughout the years.
21129,"ever tried a circle pit simulator? get on the treadmill, blast Lamb of God-Redneck, run as fast as you can and fall down face first every 30 seconds."
21130,"Not a fan of moshing, but this sounds like my type of cardio!"
21131,"Slipknot and lamb of god gets my blood boiling, perfect for weight lifting. Meshuggah for running."
21132,I need to put some Slipknot and Pantera into my workout mix
21133,"I can't believe no-one has yet mentioned *""I'll make a man out of you""* - Mulan"
21134,"I'm not trying to be a dick or anything, but seriously, why the fuck does reddit like this song so much?!? How does something like that pump you up?"
21135,"It's got it's lines in it that do legit pump you up. There's ""how could I make a man out of you?"" and if you happen to have just failed out a set or something, that's a good ""I'll show you!"" moment. And then there's a line that's similar to ""Harder, better, faster, stronger"" that goes ""We must be swift as the coursing river (Chorus yelling ""BE A MAN!"") With all the force of a great typhoon (BE A MAN!) With all the strength of a raging fire!"" I like to time my sets along with the chorus of songs and pump up lines in general, so this one does work really well. Nothing like being told to be a man when I'm about to putter out."
21136,"It's a song about not giving up, not accepting what other people tell you you cannot do and overcoming your boundaries to achieve your goal."
21137,"Wait, are people legitimately listening to this while working out? Funny either way."
21138,I also assumed it was just a running joke. I can't even imagine trying to move weight while listening to Disney music.
21139,"Just listen to the [Chinese version by Jackie Chan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SLJJc8siyU), which is naturally much more badass than the Donny Osmond original ;)"
21140,I listen to it almost every time I run.
21141,I'm not even mad.
21142,"I can't fucking stand this song. It's not catchy whatsoever and the lyrics are annoying. I really don't know why everyone in the fucking world loves it. Call me a curmudgeon, but fuck that song.

Don't get me wrong, I love the FUCK out of Disney songs, just not that one."
21143,"Not to mention the movie was great.  Definitely one of Disney's underrated ones.  I wish it had been more popular, but alas, the message of ""Go out and earn what you want!"" is far less popular than ""Wait and someone else will come along and solve your problems!"""
21144,AWOLNATION - Sail (feed me remix)
21145,The borgore remix is rowdy as fuuuck too
21146,I actually listen to NPR or TYT podcast.  My work out is also an opportunity to become more informed about the world.

21154,Black label by lamb of god works wonders for squats.
21155,"[Derezzed : The Glitch Mob/Daft Punk Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN_MSyrq6-U) This is my favorite ""in the zone"" push out reps song. At about 45 seconds it times perfectly with my reps."
21156,"Sara Bareilles and Vanessa Carlton.

...Don't judge."
21157,does vanessa carlton have more than one song? or just 'a 1000 miles' on repeat?
21158,"Pfshh.

As if there are any other songs that are worth listening to, period.

*~piano tinkles~*"
21159,Suprised at the lack of skrillex. His whole album is big beats and perfect gym music.
21160,I always time my sets with the drop.
21161,I'm convinced 'Bangarang' was MADE to do tricep dips off of a bench
21163,"Man, that's not a metal song, but that song is metal as fuck."
21164,"Machine Gun Kelly - Breaking News. 
Something about this song makes me run as fast as possible on the treadmill!"
21165,I'm a beast - Tech N9ne
21166,"I know this isn't hip hop (which is also my main go to) but this song.. when the beat drops and the dude says NO MERCY, I just want to beast everything in sight.

21167,"I like MGK for motivation. It is rap, but tends to be about pushing through personal struggles, rather than balling at the trap (which I also appreciate). When I am sitting in my bed contemplating going into my workout room, I play this:

21177,"I find electro to be great workout music. There's always a buildup, a bass drop, and breaks for the crowd - while still maintaining a steady beat throughout. Personally I like some crazy skrillex, wolfgang gartner or pendulum when I'm lifting (say what you will about the skrillex's ""musical"" status, but that shit pumps you UP), something more mellow and melodic like deadmau5, vitalic or tiesto while running. I don't even listen to the stuff on a regular basis, only when working out."

21203,"Almost anything by Andrew WK.

I know he isn't your genre, but his music is the perfect beat to run to, and his songs are so uplifting and happy that I just can't help enjoy my workout. 

edit: especially [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZyhB1-Yb4U&feature=kp)"
21204,"I know this is not music, but one time I was running on a treadmill in a hotel gym and horse racing was on tv.  That shit was motivating."

21206,One of my favourite one rep max songs Remember the Name Fort Minor

21209,The whole Hide album by Bloody Beetroots makes me want to outrun a train and bench press Hulk straight into the sky.
21210,"I find a lot of MUSE songs really build and build and you end up powering through a great cardio workout! (resistance, invincible, uprising, starlight, plug in baby, feeling good). Also.....Britney, Rihanna and Shakira never let me down! Liking the Mixerbox app but eating my data....damn gym doesn't even know their own wifi password!!!"
21211,Jimmy eat world - the pain
21212,7 instead of 8 by Rank 1.... holy crap that song can get you through some heavy lifts!
21213,"I listen to music every now and then, but 90% of the time I'm lifting without it.   I find the phone extremely distracting due to calls and text messages coming in, and lose focus extremely quickly. On top of that, I enjoy listening to myself talk and motivate myself.  I can focus on my breathing, form, and keeping my grunt level in check."
21214,A$AP Rocky Pandora.
21215,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6OwnNe9nMU - This! It's like having multiple motivational coaches in your head, mixed in with inspirational music! Also, it's an hour long which is the perfect for getting you through a longer workout. Highly recommend!"
21216,"When it comes to this topic I always found it more interesting to think about the *why* more than the *what*. Sure, it's always nice to see specific examples of the playlists, but the purpose behind the track is way more interesting to me.
 
Are the lyrics uplifting/motivating you in a specific way? 
Is the beat/groove something that meshes well with the movement of the exercise? Maybe there's a breakdown or tempo-change that allow you to grind it out a hair harder for the last set? 
What kind of mindset does it give you? Some like their music to be a supportive pat on the back before going at it, others may want it more as a way to whip up some aggressiveness before, or do you just want to feel like you're in a workout montage?

As for me, I am another headbanger, my workout playlist can generally be described as ""angry men playing really fast on their instruments and singing/screaming words of righteous fury"". I generally prefer having my music portray the feeling of someone going *I fucking dare you to keep up* rather than *Go for it bro, we got this!*. There are of course exceptions to this, but they are by far a minority and are mostly of the sort that evoke the aforementioned cinematic montage-feelings.

Good examples of what I'm talking about:

[Hypocrisy - Weed Out the Weak](http://youtu.be/BxEim1Li6ZY) .
[Fear Factory - Powershifter](http://youtu.be/flzimbVxOHI) . 
[The Resistance - I Bend, You Break](http://youtu.be/6od30MQMR30)"
21217,Amsterdam Twerk Music EP by Yellow Claw. It's all so good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX4g0sxDCEw
21218,"Try ""Perfect World"" by Dr. Octagon. Perfect build-up music."
21219,"Some of my favorite rap music to listen to when working out was produced by [Heatmakerz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heatmakerz), who did a lot of production work for Cam'ron and The Diplomats.  Whenever I'm struggling towards the end of a 10k, I'll always blast [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1IQqaYJT8I) which somehow gets me back on track evrytim."

>__The Heatmakerz__ is a [hip-hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music) production duo, originally from [Kingston, Jamaica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica), now living in New York. The duo, consisting of [Rsonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsonist) (Gregory Green) and [Thrilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrilla) (Sean Thomas), rose to fame after providing beats to various releases of [The Diplomats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomats). The bulk of albums like [Diplomatic Immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_Immunity_(album\)) and [Juelz Santana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juelz_Santana)'s debut *[From Me to U](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Me_to_U)* were produced by The Heatmakerz.  Their production style is based upon hard equalized snares and kicks, strong bass lines, strong hi-hats, snares and often sped-up soul samples.  To this day, the Heatmakerz still use the same style of production. Timothy Hodge made an appearance on Beat Bangerz alongside [Rsonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsonist).

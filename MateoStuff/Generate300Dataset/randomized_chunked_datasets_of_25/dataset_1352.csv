Catches lint, colours are very bright, and the fit isn’t well made. The bottom cutout is soft instead of rigid, so it’s a bit loose around the speakers and charging port. The silicone is so thin you can see through to the hard case within. Here are some photos to show you what I mean:

53691,"For me, constantly being tired tends to be a signal that my body is trying to fight something off.  So if I can take a day and just give in to whatever my body is asking for (ie--sleep whenever I get tired and eat whenever I am hungry), I can usually knock it out before it gets bad and decides to hang around forever.  It usually turns into a whole day of ""sleep for about 3 hours, wake up and eat something, instantly fall back asleep for about 3 hours, wake up and eat something, lather, rinse, repeat"".  But it works!!

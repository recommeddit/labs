How to break open a travel bag with a pen is going to be a ULPT by the end of the day.
Keep your lights on and hand out as much as you want.  Just make it last.  When you run out shut the porch light off.  Nobody tp's on holloween.  Its the night before they go crazy.  Just have fun with it.  Last year was my first year....went with king size.
"I travel a lot, and often on a budget. I have always looked at the bad reviews (3 or less out of 5). Look for consistency in complaints (same thing repeated) and see if they are complaints about things you would care about. An example is that at one resort that we were looking at the consistent complaints were that the bartenders didn't know how to mix good fancy tropical drinks. We drink jack and coke and other simple mixed drinks, I could care less about the fancy umbrella laden ones. Another place complained about lack of cleanliness in the rooms ... We are neat freak germaphobes, so that was a big NOPE!

It takes some time, but it Is usually worth it, especially for a honeymoon (congrats!)."
What about regular e-books?
"So hold on, is the issue at hand (unable to resolve a body multiple times) only an issue for node-fetch or is that actually specced?

My initial impression was that's it's node-fetch specific, which in that case I'd expect it to work to spec ... But if it _is_ working to spec than its purely a non-issue ..."

My mom loves cute salt and pepper shakers. She also has this 4 peas in a pod necklace. One pea for each of her kids. I got her peas in a pod salt and pepper shakers. She loves them so much she hasn't used them because she's afraid of them getting broken. She keeps them on her nightstand so she can see them all the time.
Push it to the limit
Online is cross platform except destiny no?
"Well as a millenial I've only witnessed 3 presidents.  Obama, Bush, and Bill Clinton.  Any love for Bill Clinton or am I just having nostalgia?"

"Cracking choice of console, massive selection of games and now beautifully cheap to buy games! 
I think overall I got more joy with my time on the 360 than the One.
What games you playing?"
"To counter your point, how many good people have come out of Harvard? I think a better way to put it is that the social elite go to Harvard, which gives them access to more positions of power, and more exposure to those already in power. If a bad person goes through that process, well now we have a bad player in a good position. Remember the old saying “it’s not what you know, but who you know” to an extent obviously.

Quick edit: I do agree on your opinion of those people though"

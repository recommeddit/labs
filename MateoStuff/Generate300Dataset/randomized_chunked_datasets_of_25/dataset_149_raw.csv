"Looking at overall life expectancy as well, we find that the USA is [number 37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy).

You can be healthy, but if you live in a dangerous place, death may get you anyway."

Exactly! 😀

A spec was one of the best games of the 2000s
"My manager at gamestop back in 2005 told me about the time he was a kid and ran into Jake the Snake Roberts at some diner or something while on a family trip.

Jake was sitting at a booth eating by himself. My boss was a big fan of wrestling and wanted to go over and say hello. My boss asked Jake ""where's Damien?"" and the wrestler responded, ""Right here, kid."" as he adjusted his junk. 

Seemed pretty on-brand."
"This is awesome - thank you, Gordon!"
"Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy

I was a fan of Ye since College Dripout but interest in him waned when 808 came out because I was in my ""real hip-hop"" phase. This album along with the the G.O.O.D Fridays tracks turned me into a stan. It's a masterpiece. The beats were epic and this was Kanye lyrically at his best. Easily my favorite album of all time.

Common - BE

Common's poetic lyricism, Kanye's soul sampling, John Legend lending his talents and a live performance on the Chappelle's show. What's not to love.

Ludacris - Chicken & Beer

Luda is an underrated lyricist and ""Hip Hop Quotables"" is a good example of that. Also , it's just a hood ass album. I know my mom got tired of me blasting Blow It Out. 

Danny Brown - XXX

I like it because we get the glorification of drug culture from someone who's also a victim of it and Pac Blood gives me chills whenever I hear that chorus. I love it because it gave us a pussy eating anthem and I never looked at Cool Ranch doritoes the same way ever again.

Jay Z - 444

This is a more mature Sean exercising his lyrical muscles while spitting out nuggets of wisdom. My favorite song off this changes every time I listen to it. We can talk about the social commentary and his personal life, but really, it's just great raps over dope beats."
I do .... Wasn't it molasses?
"Unless there is something you specifically object to, all you really need are drinks with 0g of sugar, which is most of what's on the market. Every brand I can think of has at least some 0g flavors, and many of the best tasting lines are exclusively sugar-free. Generally I'd recommend giving the following lines a chance: 3D, Adrenaline Shoc, Alani Nu, Beyond Raw, C4, and Xyience. If you need something value-oriented, the sugar free releases from Summit (an Aldi brand) are $1 each and surprisingly good. If you want maximum energy sans sugar, you want Total War RTD, which you can generally find at the Vitamin Shoppe, but it is pricey and targeted towards gym bros."
This!!

"My favorite drink is a Bronx Cocktail, (gin, equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, and a splash of orange juice) but that's really only good for old people who want to drink something that tastes vaguely like cough syrup so you don't drink too fast.

My favorite thing to make when I was 21 is this beverage I invented called the Mango Berry Shit Spritzer.  That's where you take whatever random fruit-punch/crystal light/whatever mix you can find, combine it in a punch bowl with 7-up, a carton of rainbow sorbet, and the cheapest vodka you can find, and serve it to your friends so they don't make their way into your closet where you keep the good booze."
"As a SAHM, yes I agree with this 100%. Something special that she can use at home, or wherever she is really. Get her a gift card to go with it so she can have something to look forward to."
"I used to drink Deer Park growing up in the south, but I can't find any in Florida for some reason. Zephyrhills has this area on lock. Lol"
"My top 3: Vanilla, Toffee / Butter Crunch, Cake Batter

Most surprising flavor: Matcha

Strangest flavor: Ben and Jerry’s ‘Late Night Snack’, which had potato chips in it"
People actually like vegemite?! I thought it was a nation-wide trick to fuck with foreigners!

"You're right, but I'm kind of ok with this because none of those shows need more attention, and every listing site has major recency bias."
Update: added Louis Vuittons Nuit de Feau! Brilliant incense perfume
"This was my first thought, too. I work in the veterinary field, and one of the first things we learned in our exotics class is that rats make the best pet."
"I have to disagree here. Typing this on my Moto One that I bought for 150€, I've seen lots of good looking Motorola phones in the last few years! (and recommended lots more as they're generally a lot of bang for your buck)

That being said I'm going to switch back to Apple in september. But that's for personal reasons as I came to more and more dislike Google so closely attached to a device I carry with me 24/7. So I'm willing to pay more for the device and less with my data later on..."

"Besides beer, a Pim's cup."
Maybe the 11 will get a price drop and then you can go for 11 and the AirPods Pro. Hope for the best 🤞🏽

From [the fetch API introduction blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/this-api-is-so-fetching/), emphasis mine -- it looks like it's the standardize behavior."
"Haha, well that's why I made a note of it ending at 2am or after :P"
"Its brave period, and waterfox, and SR Iron. Chrome and edge - uninstall)"
"It's probably a learned behavior on the Dr's part. After having so many patients who nag at him over getting the Rx, he's stopped trying to talk patients out of it and defaults to letting the patient decide for themself. 

Or it could be a prescription kickback.  They prescribe a medication so many times to get an incentive from the pharmaceutical company."
"AC Odyssey is a joke. For RPG, try

* Skyrim SE
* Witcher 3
* Persona 5
* Fallout 4
* Divinity Original Sin 2
* Kingdom Come Deliverance
* Greedfall (out in Sept)
* Outer Worlds (out in Oct)"
"I'm not big on spas or other stuff, what I wanted was TIME!

My husband did the best thing ever and offered to have a maid service come help for a few months. It's not that expensive if you get the right one (ours visits bi-monthly and it's $60 per visit) Even when I was staying home those first few months it was SO SO SO worth it. Not having to worry about clean toilets and just focus on the kid was the best present he could have ever given me!

Forget the pretty toes, a good night's sleep combined with a maid -- best present ever!"
"Congrats mate!! I’m so glad you got your hands on one! 

Mine also came out to that amount with tax. Time to enjoy it once it comes it 😎"
"I'm sitting here at my cousins in Fremont with 1 bar.  Verizon gives me so many problems in the mountains and while traveling I need to find a solution. 

I'm gonna research into Google fi"
Vim is the best editor because it can be spelled in so many incorrect ways that it's like a cornucopia for pedant grammar nazis.
TL;DR : Don't bring any luggage.
"Enjoyed your post, thanks for the summary."
"He’s playing a tiny little show today in the back of a bar, I really want to go but I have plans 😭😭😭"

">walk out with a year's supply.

So what, like...3?"
Better than globs? Strong words. I'm gonna give `mc` a try. Thanks.
"I really enjoyed the Quantum Thief series.  It's a bit hard to get your head around at first but that's part of understanding the mystery the main character is facing so you understand that too in retrospect as things progress.

Scalzi's Old Man's War is also quite good.  Redshirts is good but very snarky and third wall."
"I consider myself somewhat of a cologne aficionado, here's a list of my favorites

* (1) Issey Miyaki pour homme 
* (2) Very Sexy for Him (Victoria's Secret)
* (3) Gucci by Gucci
* (4) Lacoste pour homme

According to an eager sales guy at Macy's, a lot of my favorite colognes have sandalwood essence in common"
I've always wondered what it would be like to see Sobers bowling to Sobers.
"What? No, Canada actually has fairly competitive tax rates and decent social mobility. 

I'd choose America over Canada if I were wealthy or had a great job, as stated above. It's worth noting that both of these come with fantastic insurance and lower hospital bills. Additionally, if I get severely ill, I would rather live with debt than die on a waiting list - or at least have that option."
i really like your name (ive contacted every stets)
If you’re in Canada The Bay has some Alfred Sung polarized glasses for as little as $20. I’ve had a few pairs of the club masters and they are very good for the price.
"For the ceiling, I just did a basic flat ceiling white from Lowes. 

For my walls, I did Sherwin Williams Aesthetic White. It looks beautiful in satin. Enough contrast from the ceiling with no strong undertone. It trends on the warmer side but mostly will reflect the light coming into the room!"
Lookswise? How exactly do you feel shes changed?

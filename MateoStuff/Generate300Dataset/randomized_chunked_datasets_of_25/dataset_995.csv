16712,A friend of mine adopted a shelter dog and it bit her child in the face... not always the best idea for a first dog especially with young children. It’s not as “ethical” but just buying a puppy is so much safer for the kid,best pet for toddlers
44585,"I got ordained online like 5 1/2 years ago and have since done around 15 weddings. I'm not sure why, but people just started asking me to officiate their weddings and it kind of took off. Not ""life changing"" per se, but it has opened some doors for a side hustle, and i fucking love going to weddings.

54406,"I found the artisans jarring. My wide screen or half screen flicks in valorant / cs were fine. But the micro adjustments during pistol rounds or spray transfers was like holding a high pressure fire hose on my own with one finger. 😂

I did eventually get used to it but ultimately went back to slower pads. That control when shit hits the fan and you need to spray transfer a 3rd guy with 3-4 bullets left is just too nice.",best artisan mousepad alternatives

53264,"I've found this particular cable to be exceptional relative to Apple's other cables.  I haven't been really happy with any of the other USB-C charging cables I've tried, but the Apple cable has been bombproof.

It's worth noting that a laptop power cable isn't typically subject to nearly the same abuse as a phone cable as laptops aren't really moved around that much while charging, and with the detachable cable, wrapping it around the charging brick is no longer a source of strain.  The cable itself is also a bit thicker which helps with strain relief.  

I don't know why you got downvoted so hard here.",best usb c charging cable

9112,"Oh my god Sensodyne. One night I fell asleep with a pair of those teeth whitening strips on for a few hours. The pain the next morning was indescribable.  

You know that feeling of pain you get when you bite into a huge scoop of ice cream? That horrible cold, electric discomfort? Amp that up by 10. I couldn't talk because when I would suck in a breath the pain intensified. I was pretty much in tears at work.

I took a co worker's advice and got Sensodyne and was basically brushing my teeth every 30 minutes. and spitting into a trashcan by my desk.

 It temporarily took away the pain. It was amazing.",best toothpaste

14963,"Nothing, I hope - I hated that book.  It falls into that so-common pattern where the female protagonist is supposed to be smart and tough, but she does weak and bloody stupid stuff over and over again.

We're in the minority on this one, though.  Most of my friends loved it, so I have wincingly recommended it to others.",best romantic novel

40463,I'd look into a used gtx 1080 then because there are some good priced ones under $300 and that gpu performs the same as a 2070. The good thing about the 30 series cards are all the pascal cards are becoming really cheap so if I were you i'd get a gtx 1070 or 1080. gtx 1070= gtx 1660 ti and 1080= rtx 2070.,best midrange GPU

38147,Hahaha. Arguing on the internet is the only thing passing the time for me in lockdown. I mean as long as people realize we're arguing on the internet and remain respectful which you're clearly being. I like people that feel passionately about movies even if they disagree. And the important thing to remember is that we can all agree on one simple truth: Hulk sucks. (Just his standalone movie. I enjoy Ruffalo much more especially in Ragnarok and Endgame.),best Marvel movie

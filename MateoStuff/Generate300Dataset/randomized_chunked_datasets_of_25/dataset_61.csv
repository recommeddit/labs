30874,"Singapore is a great country to live in - but the consistency may end up boring you.

No-one talks about the weather - because it is the same every day.  Tomorrow will be 31 or 32C and you will probably get a thunderstorm late afternoon.

The difference between the longest day (mid-Summer) and the shortest day (mid-Winter) is only 8 minutes - so the sun always comes up about 7am and goes down about 7pm.

Some things are horribly expensive - real estate, cars, petrol, some food, booze.

Some things are ridiculously cheap - Some food, Taxis, MRT (Subway trains), Internet (and it is fast), cable TV, massages...",best country to live in

62794,"A useful introductory book is Data Science by Kelleher and Tireney. [http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-science](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-science)

I say useful because it is a high level survey of the Data Science landscape and capabilities and good for business managers to get an understanding of what the technologies are capable of providing to the business. Also useful when somebody asks you to explain data science to them ""in five minutes"". After a quick overview you can refer them to this book. If they get it and read it you can have a meaningful conversation and if they dont they were likely never really interested in the first place and they will probably no longer waste your time!!!",Best Data Science textbook

25294,"As a proud raimimemer, Tobey all the way.

Why? Cheesy, Superhero nostalgia.

Superhero movies are mostly way too serious now than the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy ever was. And that's fine when the story requires it, but a superhero movie is basically us suspending disbelief in order to enjoy this two hour feature, so no one would really mind if some things were over the top.

It's why Shazam is good too. I really enjoyed it.",best spiderman actor

As I live here and have only visited two other countries (Canada and Mexico) I don't think I have the authority to say which is the best to live in, as I have not lived anywhere else, but... I will say from the places I have been, Vancouver, Canada seems like it would be the best to live in.",best country to live in

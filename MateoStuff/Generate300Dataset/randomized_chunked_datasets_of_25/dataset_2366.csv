13125,"Practical: food for mom and dad
Typical: diapers (size 1) most new parents get enough newborn and they grow out of them fast. 
Wow: gift certificate for a newborn photo session

The thing with new moms is that if they have a decent sized family/friends list is that everyone gets them stuff. 

Don’t buy clothes, the kid will probably never wear it. The first few months they’re in sleepers a lot. And everyone does the “this was soooo cute” had to buy it.

The best gift is to find a way to make their life easier. Walk their dog, bring them dinner, let mom and baby have time to bond.",best gifts for mom

65737,"I think it's true that departmental rankings matter more, but general rankings are generally true too. As in, on average a higher ranked school has higher ranked undergraduate programs as well as student quality of life.

I think that these things matter in terms of student happiness, mental health, quality of education, and employ-ability. Also more than 1/3 of undergraduates change their majors at least once, and it's good to know that if you go to a university and change majors, you will have a higher chance of finding other good programs too.

Not saying that these rankings are the end-all-be-all, but it's disingenuous to say that they're meaningless, no?",best college in california

34763,"Walter Payton. He was a very complete player, could run, block, catch, do everything and he did it all at a very high level. He didn't miss games. He was as tough as it gets. He was remarkably powerful for a guy his size. He was on some really bad Bears teams for a lot of his career but still produced big numbers every year.

He is the GOAT.",best NFL player

I forget which brand has the thin rectangular chunks of chocolate in the ice cream but I love taking a bite, spitting out the chocolate pieces, and when I'm done with my ice cream I then have a small hill of vaguely minty chocolate to enjoy.  It's probably the same enjoyment as eating a Rice Krispy treat kernel by kernel",best ice cream flavor
30125,"We still covered it, they just didn’t emphasize the importance of that war nearly as much as the others. When we did discuss it, our teachers focused more on the geopolitical implications regarding the civil war than anything else. It was approached kind of like, “so this thing happened, and that’s how we got Texas and a good chunk of the southwest. But because of that, here’s all the bullshit it caused in our own government!”",best Mexican war to study

28906,"Oatmeal is in a class of its own in terms of healthy, inexpensive, fast, and easy. 

If i wanted to be extreme about minimizing prep time/eating in the car, I would leave all the oatmeal ingredients in my car.

The per serving containers, oatmeal packets or a large container of instant oatmeal + raisins, nuts, whatever you like. Plus 5 tupperware containers and spoons. Leave it all in the car in a lunchbox or something. 

Then use an electric kettle and a thermos. 

First thing in the morning press the start button on the kettle. Takes 2-3 minutes to boil. Then get ready for work. On the way out the door  pour the hot water in the thermos. In the car, pour hot water into a tupperware with the oatmeal and let it steep while you're driving. 

Voila. Super healthy breakfast, minimum time commitment.",best breakfast foods

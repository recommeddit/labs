"According to pffs top 10 edge players posted here yesterday, Mack isn’t even top 10 edge 🤦‍♂️"
Kings of the Wyld did it for me.
"Santa Cruz. It's the newest/most modern out of the Chi 5 dorms, ocean view from some rooms, close to DLG (dining common), and the one I've generally heard the least complaints about (regarding ants, bedbugs, broken elevators because it's a low-rise, etc.) I had a bunch of friends in Santa Cruz my freshman year so I was there a lot, seemed a lot nicer to live in than San Mig, where I lived."
L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent. Some of my female friends have told me it smells really good.
Interesting combo there. I'm an Econ major who is considering minoring in Stats.
"Also, I heard that ryzen is heavily reliant on ram so if my ram is not good my pc wouldn't run well?"

"Hi, if you want something cost effective, the Gateway 15.6"" on my list with the Ryzen 5 3450U CPU is a good choice. It offers very solid specs for the price, but if you want to buy from a more reputable brand, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14"" on my list is a good choice too."
It’s 4.99$
Verge specifies “for most people” because you’ve got the nerds who insist they can’t live without Windows Phone Live Tiles or Android NFC tags
"Unless you eat, sleep, and breathe architecture do not even consider it as a major. You will spend more money, more sleepless nights, and more of your sanity than any other student. Unless you have the passion necessary to make those sacrifices, forget it. Learn from my mistakes."

How many people are on your group? When are you thinking of going?
Once you have a budget if you want to keep a record each week of spending money there is an app called Balance that is a simple ledger for deposits and withdrawals. It's one thing to know how much you have to spend but to keep track of it as it's happening during the course of the week really helps me.
This near Letchworth???
Once yin get used to reds they are real nice.
"I went to college, studied Philosophy and Religion. Started working at a great company. Haven't looked back since."
"I didn't find out about the Roomba until after I had the Dyson. It definitely sounds WAY more ideal, but I'm going to get my monies worth out of the one I have first. Can you imagine "" Hunny, I know you just spent $500 on a vacuum, but I found one I like more, soooo yeah.."" Im pretty sure he'd blow a fuse! Ha."
Too funny. I have the white/silver iphone 6 with the black Candyshell case.
"Isn't NFL's list more canonical than Athletic, which is just another sports new site.

And I do mean, just another sports news site, they aren't exactly considered standard or anything."
My whole place is a warm grey. Grey has cool and warm undertones and varies greatly. Would recommend grabbing some sample warm Grey pots and showing him
Oh! That’s good to know. Good things are meant to be competitive else it is robbed of its goodness.
I wear the same combination! Ha
"I would really like to find an editor which I find as comfortable as TeXshop for Mac OS X. Things which I miss:

 - find/replace as a single unified dialog, with multiple line fields for both find and replace text, and good support for Regular Expressions
 - support for emacs keyboard shortcuts (TeXshop gets this for free)
 - support for native text objects so that it works well on systems w/o powerful CPUs (writing this out on an Atom tablet) and interactions such as handwriting recognition
 - some sort of plug-in system for things such as sorting the current selection (in lieu of Mac OS X's Services)"
FYI: You can delete your dupe post. :)

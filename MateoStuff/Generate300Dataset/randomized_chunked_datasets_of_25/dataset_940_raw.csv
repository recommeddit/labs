"Thanks for the 411!

I did notice that you listed the cost as being $25/month in a different column, but it's pretty far off to the right, and I didn't know what to make of that when I first saw it.

Maybe the price could be listed as $25-$40, or something. Though I guess that would mess up sorting the column by price. D'oh!"
Do they individually bag candy corn? Or did they just give you a handful 😂

"Home fries; cheesey, buttery grits; sunny-side-up eggs with huge, goopy yolks; and white toast with strawberry jam. Orange juice and a coffee to drink."
"Yeah IMO Forbes, although not really considered by most people because of it's ""against the norm"" rankings, is actually one of the more accurate lists out there. Also, OP this ranking is seriously good, it seems to match the overall consensus here a lot more than most rankings. /u/acadranking 

**Edit:** Also, a general question - why are LACs excluded in a lot of rankings like US News?

Ok what did I say something wrong... why is this downvoted lol."
"Came to say this. Best romance I’ve ever read hands down. It was my gateway book that got me into the genre. I haven’t put them down since! Christian and Maddie are such nuanced multi-layered characters and you get to watch them slowly fall in love. I also loved how different they are but how good they are for each other. His speech at the end, oof. Maddie girl, sigh. ❤️"

"I know you’re looking for a cologne suggestion, but you might want to consider just not wearing cologne at all. Of course it’s nice to smell nice, but “nice” is very subjective. Smelling like nothing (or maybe like your soap or laundry detergent) is always the least offensive to the most people. 

Edit: And, wearing no cologne will never be a deal breaker. Wearing [cologne name] might be a turn off."
LETS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS!
"Hi! This is a great post thanks a lot! I am a consultant/data analyst and currently I do lots of tasks on excel. I wanted to buy MacBook M1 but it's not working well with excel so I checked other products on the market. I was mainly considering dell XPS 13 9310 but i see lots of complaints about the QC. Did you consider QC in your listings? 

Also what would be your all around recommendation for me? Getting an ultrabook like XPS 13 or HP or looking for something slim but not an ultrabook? This is a big dilemma for me right now.
Once again thanks a lot! Great work"
"DiRT 2. To me it strikes the perfect balance between having handling that is complex enough to be interesting and arcadey enough to be fun. Specifically because of flashbacks, which mean that if you having issues at a particular spot on the track, you can retry it many times without having to waste several minutes on every try."
right but then you have open buckets of water sitting around everywhere.
"Yeah, a bit"
"The webcams you listed are both USB webcams, which are not as good as DSLR cameras but more than good enough for streaming. There is no need to invest in the most expensive equipment.  


Out of the c920 and the c922, the latter is the better model. The c920 can record 30 FPS at 1080p/720p, while the c922 can record 30 FPS at 1080p or 60 FPS at 720p. The c922 can also do some cool background removal effects, similar to what you can get through Nvidia Broadcast's digital green screen."

"If you're looking for the best bang for your buck,  maybe look into qnix monitors.  Picked up a 27 inch 1440p one a while ago and was able to overclock it to 90Hz.  Theyre around the $200-250 mark.  Beware though as some people receive theirs with dead pixels (I didn't,  but some do)."
"21st birthday? Oh no my friend. You don't do a normal mixed drink. You get a long island iced tea followed by shots all night. Just make sure you've got a good DD/babysitter. Also, happy birthday!"

Mindhunter is my favorite Netflix show
"I bought Kevin Smith a beer at a airport lounge, we wound up shooting the shit, after a while he bought a piece of pie and we split it."
"I got the LG 27gl850 this year, one had some weire problem and a dead pixel and the second one has a dead pixel and has since gotten another dead pixel.

However during normal use I don't see these dead pixels at all really and the quality of this monitor absolutely outweighs the issue of the deadpixel, its a beautiful screen and games run like a dream with my 1080ti. 

I absolutely recommend it I had two Asus monitors beforehand and both had horrendous ips glow and backlight bleed while neither of my LG 27GL850's had any backlight bleed at all."

"Oh man, if I had a few months to complete it, I'd be so interested.

I've done a few, Katahdin was by far my favorite. I highly recommend if you're ever in Maine for some time!"

16802,"\*LOL* That's brilliant, the cat growling!

My interactive cat is similar with most visitors, she stalks off outside and performs her magic spells and rituals... after a few hours she usually returns to find they have worked and that the strange humans have gone. Occasionally, the method fails her - she returns, looks somewhat annoyed and slinks off again.

In her heyday, my other cat has literally bitten guests, unprovoked. When she growls it is a serious warning!",best pet for toddlers

I dont think other teams ever think about these rankings but other teams are aware of what a good team Belgium is. Weird to say otherwise... We’ve beaten Brazil, England, France, Portugal in recent years. It’s not like it’s a coincidence we are top of the rankings and 3rd at the WC",best soccer team in the world
2329,"Actually, yes you have plenty of options. 

If you want the best sounding closed back wireless headphones without ANC, the $380 (on sale) Drop THX Panda is a great choice. They use planar drivers and have THX's AAA amp technology. It has LDAC for semi-lossless streaming. If you have an iPhone LDAC does not matter, it does not support it. 

If you don't mind open back, the HiFiMan Deva for $300 is an excellent choice. I had the drop wired version, the HE-5XX and they sounded awesome except for a slight treble distortion at high volumes. This also has LDAC. 

If you wanted to go cheaper, the AKG K361BT is a good option for about $100-ish. It does not have LDAC. 

If you needed ANC, one of the best sounding options is the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless for $350 (on sale).",best headphones

32248,"I live near Niagara Falls NY and unfortunately this is a true fact. Before the modern era it was a really popular spot for travelers to take their lives and the only evidence that it happened were abandoned cars (and carriages as it was a really popular suicide site in the late 1800s)

It's a horrible way to go (you drown at the Horseshoe Falls or you get bashed against rocks at the American Falls) and an unknown but likely large percentage of bodies are never recovered.  Back in pre- Border Patrol days people used to jump off the Rainbow Bridge that connects the US & Canada and either die from the impact with the Niagara River or were swept into the Rapids and Whirlpool to drown. 

It's always sad to hear of someone going missing because of the possibility of suicide and just a couple weeks ago it happened with a young college student from NYC who did it over a breakup. They only know it happened because the police dogs traced her right to the waters edge. I only wish someone had seen her and could have persuaded her not to do it, especially when she had so much life left to live and no relationship is worth dying over.",best hotel to live in

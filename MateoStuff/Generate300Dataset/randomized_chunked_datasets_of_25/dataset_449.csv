13823,"Kurt Adelberger (astronomer) is the best writer of scientific papers I've come across. Ha manages to put popular-science-style exciting prose into professional research papers. An example here:

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401445

The first paragraph:

>As the photons from the microwave background stream towards earth they are gradually joined by other photons, first by those produced in the occasional recombinations of the intergalactic medium, later by those cast off from cooling H2 molecules, later still, after hundreds of millions of years, by increasing numbers from quasars and galaxies, by bremsstrahlung from the hot gas in galaxy groups and clusters, and finally, shortly before impact, by photons emitted by the Milky Way’s own gas and stars and dust. All reach the earth together. They provide a record of the history of the universe throughout its evolution, but it is a confused record. Two photons that simultaneously pierce the same pixel of a detector may have been emitted billions of years apart by regions of the universe that were in vastly different stages of evolution. One of the challenges in observational cosmology is to separate the layers of history that we on earth receive superposed.",best research paper archive

It's got a magnifying glass in the center so it's great if you do any sort of hands-on work, but the lamp itself is also quite nice.",best desk lamp
64793,"If you’re a fan of simpler sushi and a focus on delicious fish, I agree with Arigato over some of the others mentioned.

I’ll also second Paxti’s for pizza, I always end up there people watching from their great bar facing State Street,  amazing deep dish pizza I‘be been known to drive from LA for.

If you have a vegetarian in the group I highly suggest Vegan GreenGO on State.  I’ve only been there once but they make all their own “meats” and they were all truly delicious. Go even if you aren’t vegetarian and balance out one of your more indulgent meals!

The Palace is great for a satisfying Cajun experience with friends. It’s been so popular for years I don’t think it gets mentioned here much, similar to La SuperRica for tacos.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara

Seriously though, decent camera sensors alone aren’t cheap. Sony probably has a major market share and Logitech probably just buys the low end sensors from suppliers like them. People often think Logitech is a great company and sometimes they make nice toys but they’re ultimately low quality, nice looking, and convenient. They’re like the Bose of computer peripherals.",best webcamera

5414,"I used to go to Menards for everything but I feel like in the last 5 to 6 years, the quality of some of their products (kitchen and bath, tools and flooring to name a few) has trended towards the cheaper end. I worked there for four years when I was in high school and college, so I tried to stay loyal but I've made the jump to Home Depot for most of my home improvement needs. I only go to Menards in a pinch because it's closer.

As for HD or Lowes, they seem pretty similar from my experience.",best home improvement store

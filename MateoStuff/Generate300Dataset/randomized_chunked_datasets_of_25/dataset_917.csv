18668,"Others have mentioned most of these in comments already, but my go-to music-related Youtube channels are [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/user/havic5), [Sideways](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7l9chXMljpUft67vw78qw), [Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/user/pegzch), [12 Tone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUtqcDkzw7bisadh6AOx5w), and [8-bit Music Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZLO2VgbZHeDcongKzzfOw). Getting a bit more niche, I enjoy most of [Samurai Guitarist's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/samuraiguit) and [Jens Larsen](https://www.youtube.com/user/jenslarsen02) does some neat Jazz music stuff. I was pretty big on [Music is Win](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshiNtfJ7Dj3nlh41a6M-kg), [Sean Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/user/seandaniel23), and [YourGuitarSage](https://www.youtube.com/user/yourguitarsage) in the past, but I haven't been keeping up with those three channels lately. Finally, [Dan Erlewine's videos for Stewart MacDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUUuMzxJ9h8) are amazing.",best YouTube video

47037,"Good question!  Endospores are basically small, dormant, heavily protected copies of the bacteria that reside within the confines of the cell wall, alongside the bacteria itself.  Alcohol will absolutely kill the main bacterial cell but the endospore will often survive.  Under the right conditions the endospore can grow into another active bacterium.  

A common bug spread in hospitals, C.difficile, is known for having this mechanism.  That’s why hospital staff are told to specifically wash their hands after contact with patients suspected to have this; the alcohol won’t reliably kill the endospores.",best hand santizer brand

10672,"Been traveling internationally since the 70s. Visited about 25 countries. 15 of the years often with wife and kids. Not once anything stolen. Always followed three rules. First, never check anything worth stealing. Second, always “lock”my checked bag with twisty bag ties. I assumed a lock is no more secure than the tie, but the latter prevents accidental opening and is a signal there is nothing inside worth stealing. Third, carry anything valuable and keep it close.

Once or twice it looked like maybe somebody had opened a checked bag but nothing was missing.",best suitcase lock

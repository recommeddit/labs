"Majored in chemical engineering.

Kid Toasty always wanted to make video games. I think I'd go back for computer science/art double major. People say, ""If you love video games, don't get a job making them."" Adult Toasty isn't finding that same spark when playing video games but the idea of making imagination into reality is still there."
"water and fever.
Fever goes up, bring it down. Then let it go up again. And then bring it down. Just try not to let it get too high, and your cold leaves faster.

also, it only works if you have a fever"

"> but only the model which costs a lot more

The Model Y Standard Range isn't technically sold (though apparently you can get them if you call) and doesn't have a price.  All Model Y's have the long range battery.  The 60 kWh is only sold on the Model 3.

And yeah, I don't understand the quibbling here.  Indeed per numbers at ev-database the Tesla charging system sinks about 70% more power, or (because of somewhat higher efficiency) 86% higher rate of  recovered range.  The article seems spot on to me.  The ID.4 isn't really that impressive as a vehicle, but a crossover at $40k is pretty attractive for a lot of market segments.

That's not completely surprising for a vehicle that costs 30% more."
Why you gotta hate on necco wafers?
Goes well with muffins.
New sun and snow crash below neuromancer... heresy!
Oh yes I get mad when the bartender doesn’t give me one 😩
You have tons of freedom with CCS. I am selling my Model 3 for a Mustang Mach-E and there will be no reduction of my freedom. Not everyone lives where CCS sucks and Tesla is good.
Marty’s on De La Vina is a hidden gem!! They do takeout only I think but have THE BEST classic flavorful pizza
Everything is number one?
If u want gaming go full on Sennheiser. Honestly most of their gaming headphones sound pretty much the same. I am not aware of their top headphones for gaming but few years back Game zero was above average and still is a good choice.
Moscow mule! So tasty
True. But King’s Island has had the better last decade.
Was very surprised by the quality of Diesel colognes. If Only the Brave wasn't in such a ridiculous bottle I think it would sell very well.
"Without study abroad??? **Noooooooo. **

Heck, I did a language *minor* and some of my classmates complained that it’s not printed on the degree so they “can’t” put it on their resume for some prestige. I’ve brought many to light that if your language skills are good enough you *can* put [Language - Proficiency], and that you don’t have to put it on if you can’t speak the language anymore.

And congrats with your studies!"
Being genre defining has nothing to do with how long it’s been released for. There’s albums newer than Piñata that are already genre defining like TPAB or even Culture by Migos.
"Yes, if you remove the morality, character dynamics, social relevance, plot, sympathy, real-world meaning, and impetus for the art itself, you're left with a bad film. As every film would be.

Remove the politics from Iron Man and what do you have? Rich guy makes a suit I guess. Snore."

"Seconded.    

It is a very high quality port of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and works much better on touch than I would have imagined. The only IAPs it has is three expansion sets (Wacky Worlds, Time Twister, and Toolkit), which I'd call optional.   

It is kind of the polar opposite of most mobile games, no annoying ads, no conveyor belt of ""challenges"", limited & valuable IAPs, and deep gameplay."
That range is pretty extreme.
"We have both, one across from the other. The Lowe's is smaller then a typical one and not arranged like most Lowe's. 


Every time I have walked in there (over a dozen times) they don't have what I need. Infuriating. I went in there in the dead of winter to buy a zone control. I needed three zones but I could get by with one. They literally do not carry any in the store. Single zone included. You've got to be kidding me. Depot had singles in stock. Talked to a employee, called around and found me a store which had them in stock. Verified and had them hold it for me. 

I won't go into that Lowe's anymore. As others said thought - depends greatly upon the store."

"Sick, any word on the moba release date?"
I’m a Verizon employee and I believed the hype and switched from simple to Verizon and service was terrible! I had to switch back lol. It really depends on where you live though

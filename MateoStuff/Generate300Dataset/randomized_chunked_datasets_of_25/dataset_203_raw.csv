Any favorites/suggestions?"

Rogues of the Republic series by Patrick Weekes.  First book is The Palace Job.
"Just to chime in here, the interest of the US reached beyond greed.  I highly suggest you check out A Bodyguard of Lies by Anthony Brown; Brown suggests that FDR actually ""warmongered"" the US into a position suitable for intervention in Europe.  These warmongering actions include rousing anti-German sentiments, quietly of course, pushing US trading vessels into german uboat zones, provoking Japan (offering outlandish peace settlements, oil embargo), and not acting on the tip that Japan was planning to attack Pearl Harbor.  This claim is supported by founded evidence we have on FDR's strong anti-isolationist sentiments, strong pro-British sentiments, and his anti-nazi stance."

"1. Berserk-
This got me into anime and helped develop a taste for good story telling. In particular the parallels of Guts wondering what to do in life and who he is is something I can relate to.

2. Monogatari series-
This series can be confusing but it explains things pretty well at the end of each arc. I always enjoyed that the Mc learned what was going on when I did.

3. Highschool DxD-
I don't need a reason.

4. Oregairu-
Like alot of people I can relate to the Mc but I wouldn't go to the lengths he does to help people.

5. One Piece-
I feel like most of my love for one piece died 300 eps ago but those first 500 were some of my favorite parts of anime."
"If you and any other children still live at home, find a way to give them regular alone time, no questions asked. Don't make me explain that."
"Upgraded the **RAM** & installed an **SSD** on my 10 year old laptop - **$75** (for both, used from **craigslist**). Works blazing fast like a new laptop. Using the old hard drive as an external memory storage backup (using a SATA USB cable for $5) & sold the old RAM for $10.

**HD USB webcam** to replace my built in laptop camera (which is really low resolution) - **$15 from Amazon**

**Silicone keyboard cover** that makes typing feel luxurious and prevents dust and grime from getting in - **$6 from eBay**

**Essential Oil Diffuser from Costco - $40**. Love trying different blends/scents depending on my mood. Runs for 7 hrs straight and leaves the room smelling fresh."

"The Book of the New Sun is #2 ?!?

Interesting..."
This is the one
Stranger in a Strange Land is such a great book! I’d rather a religion had been created from this book instead of anything by L. Ron Hubbard’s work.
"I've read that baking soda promotes healing, and I've tried it myself to positive results.  Usually I just dump some baking soda right on there, maybe mixed with some water.  Pretty painful, but it makes the canker sore go away after a day or two.  I guess the question is whether the preventative/healing benefits of having baking soda in the toothpaste outweighs the harm of the sodium lauryl sulfate."
It doesn't? You can make it exactly how you want it. It's the best thing about cooking.
"Correct. The territory was in dispute where a few skirmishes allegedly occurred. We took those weak confrontations and amphibiously assaulted Mexico at Veracruz. Our first excursion, as a nation, onto foreign soil."
"First quickly learn and understand the difference between ""back\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""server\-side""\) and ""front\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""client\-side""\) web development. Next learn HTML and CSS, which are essential to learn first since they are necessary for the ""front\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""client\-side""\) on all websites no matter what. Next move on either to advanced ""front\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""client\-side""\) by learning Javascript, or move on to ""back\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""server\-side""\) by learning a popular server\-side web language like PHP, C# DotNet, Server\-Side Node.js, Ruby, etc. Finally once you know the basics of front\-end and back\-end development languages you could learn about popular libraries, frameworks and CMS software built on top of the languages you know, but its best to understand the fundamentals first before learning extra layers of abstractions built on top."

54482,"Thank you! Love this collection. Grats on your future hien, you'll love it!

1. The hien is going to be a good bit faster than what you're used to. IMO you'll adjust rather quickly and the low static friction will be a fantastic upgrade for your tracking ability. The stopping power will be a bit of an adjustment, but muscle memory will kick in eventually.
2. Viper mini with stock feet might be a little scratchy on hien, at least mine was. Swapping to core pads was really helpful on my viper mini. I think they're in stock on lethalgaming gear and it's by far the easiest mod as you just peel off the stock ones, clean the surface, and add the new pads. That being said, it's very usable, just a bit scratchy. 
3. The hardest question! It was the hien for a long time, but hayate otsu v2 took the crown though I love all 5!",best artisan mousepad alternatives
51924,I agree. I saw a lot of posts complaining how they changed the material to a cheaper leather and it doesn’t age like the older Apple leather cases. I’ve had older Apple leather cases that I loved so I bought the Golden Brown. As soon as I took it out of the box you can feel the difference compared to the old cases. They feel cheaper and overall lesser quality. I’m planning on returning it and going with Nomad or Woolnut instead.,best iphone case
28606,"A poptart contains 219 calories, and very little else and cost 41 cents per pastry.

Eggs are somewhere between $1 and $3 per dozen, contain 90 calories per egg and cost 8 cents each. 

So a three egg omelette every morning worth 270 calories would cost 24 cents plus a nominal amount for fat to fry it in, or about half of what a poptart costs. 

I suggest you begin to buy your own basic foods and cook breakfast, it'll taste much better.",best breakfast foods

63759,"So implementation intention is a good one. Willpower is a finate resource so making things simple and automatic are important when creating habits for the times when you have no energy motivation or willpower. 

BJ Fogg from http://tinyhabits.com/ does this implementation intention thing by creating a cue in your daily life which acts as the trigger for when you start your new habit. For instance putting your running shoes by the front door when switch off the downstairs light before you go upstairs to bed. The cue or hook is something that you already do habitually at the same time that you want to create this new habit.

Check it out. Powerful stuff.

Lastly I will say that willpower is great but I think it still can not help to motivate you entirely when you feel that there is no strong purpose for doing what it is you are attempting.",best books for building better habits reddit

When you do the installation, I highly recommend that you setup a separate /home directory.

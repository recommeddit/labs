28793,"I recommend investing in an egg cooker.  Makes cooking them to desired doneness very easy and they tend to peel easier as well.  Also, when peeling them put them under cold water and peel there.  All shells will float and they come off way easier.

62925,"For me the only item on the list I’d  might be interested in is the data science job one. By the look of it, all Of the others are focused on learning specific techniques and I don’t need a list to find a good book in machine learning. 

I think what I was hoping to get were some books outlining and discussing trends and developments in the industry, asking interesting questions or talking about data science in a more abstract level then code. 


But that’s just my opinion! Might be because I don’t feel like there are many resources with those topics in mind (glad to be proven wrong!)",Best Data Science textbook

9282,"Not true. I’m a dentist. Just like people are supposed to diet and exercise, many don’t brush and floss as often or as thoroughly. Despite coaching people relentlessly on how to be better, many just won’t do anything until they have to or until it’s too late. It makes my freaking day when someone shows up and their teeth are gorgeous, I legit get giddy and tell them how great they’re doing- one less person I have to preach to. 

Any toothpaste with fluoride, sensodyne if your teeth hurt with cold water. But above all else, get an electric toothbrush. Spend the $100 and get a sonicare or an oral-b and floss at night. I honestly believe it’s the cheapest and best investment you can make for long term dental health. Oh! And don’t forget to brush along the gum line!",best toothpaste

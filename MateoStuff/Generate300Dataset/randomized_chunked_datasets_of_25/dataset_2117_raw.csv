"Stephen King had an actual AOL account he used regularly, I knew through someone who worked with him. Funny thing is, it said his name and stuff right there on his profile. Anyone could have messaged him.

I told him I admired his work and he was nice and chatted and said thanks. Wasn't rude. Didn't block me. We exchanged a few dick pics and that was it."
i didn't think seattle would be the right conditions for saffron
Magoos has my vote easily
"Indeed. The FDA list includes hypochlorite as a high level disinfectant, though there is only one listing for it for the specific purpose of disinfecting endoscopes (hypochlorite is specifically good at killing c. difficile which infects the gastrointestinal tract which is where we stick endoscopes I guess). 

The rest are more widely applicable.

This site categorises hypochlorite as an intermediate level disinfectant."
"The best thing about the saw movies for me was when I told my sister I went to see Saw II. 

Her response was ""I saw Saw II, too!"""
Good man yourself!
"This is absolutely amazing! I've been hearing from many people that the rankings on BGG are skewed towards newer games, which distorts the results away from titles that are actually more popular in terms of numbers of players, etc. Can you explain a little about your methodology in creating this list?"
"Linen & Sky

by Febreeze

I shit you not.

Have had many, many girls compliment me on my smell, despite the fact that i'm a smoker. Did have one girl say I smelled like laundry, but there was definitely a hint of horny in her tone of voice"
"Right Kim invited her, but not Khloe or Lamar. It was they’re one year anniversary so Khloe probably only invited close family and friends. Snooki was none of that to her so Kim should have told Khloe in advance instead of letting her be caught off guard while drunk."
"Vifm is my goto. 

90% I'm using z.lua and all the other core utils but for that 10% I zuse vifm since it has everything. Previews, intuitive you name it"
"HP Omen 15 MicroCenter's version can be an option. Its got i7-8750H, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD, GTX 1060 non Max-Q and ThunderBolt 3 port."
"I'd also be interested in a cut of the movie where you see all the cabin crew scenes in order till the GodHand, then cut back to the beginning of the office crew scenes."
"I'm not sure as I haven't been in SB very long but agreed! Places like Ginos, Lucky Penny are much better but I rank Bettina above all. Their margherita  and mushroom pizzas are divine :)"
"Author, not book, but I definitely pause a lot and think ""is this particular Sarina Bowen book *really* responsive, or do I just really like Sarina Bowen and want to smash one of her books until it fits the gap someone is asking for?""

I still recommend her a lot but hopefully I've held off on the inapplicable ones."
But I'd rather go for the Big Cash Prize!
"Mint's beginnings were just as humble as Ynab's .. Intuit bought out mint in 2009 - intuit did not create mint, but in my opinion they are quickly destroying it with ads/solicitations."
Holy crap
"This is my routine when I get a cold.

1. Drink a large amount of orange juice.
2. Take a very hot shower.
3. Put on warm pants, socks, and a sweater.
4. Go to bed under a warm comforter or several blankets.

I always wake up feeling like a new man."
Out of stock now lol
Very much appreciate the info!
"Best is probably the newest one but for me it’s my current iPhone X because I don’t have the iPhone 11 Pro Max 😕

I don’t have a worst iPhone as they have all be great at that point in time when I had them."
"I think he's more commenting on the fact that the show about the topless gender bender is 69, if you know what I mean."
Acqua Di Gio > Old Spice.

"I recently switched over to Zebra and just want to note that it loads everything noticeably faster than Cydia ever did, so in that respect they definitely fixed something that was broken."

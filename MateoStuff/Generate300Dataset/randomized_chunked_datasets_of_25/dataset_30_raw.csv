Hana Kitchen is pretty good value in my opinion.
"At Costco right now (in the US) you can get a CAT jump starter that’s also a compressor to fill your tires as well as a power station with 120v, 12v, USB plug ins for $99. 

Perfect for camping and if the power goes out as well."
"That’s what I got for my 13 Pro, I got the golden brown (which is orange for the record)"
Is it hard to find?

It’s unfortunate they made the leather cases so poorly last year and seems like it’s the same. No more patina

"Yeah I really don’t need “people we meet on vacation” recommended to me again 😂 impressed with Emily Henry’s publicist though, they’re clearly doing something right"

"> I want to use a phone for 4-5 years. 

For 2-3 years I would say go for the XR, but if you want it to last until 2024 or 2025 then I say don't.  
The phone was released in 2018, so in 2024 it will be 6 years old, that's super outdated. Just for example, the iPhone 6 is 6 years old now and iPhone 5S is 7. I would either go for a newer model or get the XR but lower my expectations."
This is also pretty much why TV speakers and AAA video games have been getting progressively worse over the years. :p
So is cocaine!
Thankfully I think all UCs have the blue and gold opportunity program! It's a great thing and I wouldn't be able to afford college if it didn't exist
It's weird to see this as something different. Electric kettles are the more commonly used kettles in the UK. Not many people use hob kettles any more
You're not my mom!

"Thanks for reminding me of ticktick, I have used it in the past, but I forgot that it had a calendar too. I will try it again and see if it works."
CVS or Walgreens? That level of candy just feels like you buy them at a drug store like werthers and cough drops.
Used to watch ranma as a kid (I know) don’t remember much. Is it really good and worth a watch?
That's really smart! I've noticed it getting more difficult to find things in both my music and book libraries - I'll try something similar; it's a little like sub-libraries :D

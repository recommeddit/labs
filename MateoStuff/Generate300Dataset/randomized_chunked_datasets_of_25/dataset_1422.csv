31532,"Grand Wailea on Maui? We had a trip planned there for next month, but they just announced that visitor quarantine has been extended through July, so we're going to have to cancel :(

We used to live about a mile away from the Grand, so we've been excited to take the kids there (and maybe make it a bit of a tradition).",best hotel to live in

16730,"Although I think rats are a far better choice than a hamster or rabbit, I'll be the odd one out and also suggest some beginner reptiles. They are infinitely easier to care for than fish and can be incredibly gentle, rewarding pets. Unlike rats, they have essentially zero social requirements, i.e. your reptile will not mind if it becomes a pet that doesn't get held every day. I would personally recommend corn snakes, which are a more active species that likes to slither and explore, or ball pythons, most of which will happily curl up anywhere warm and stay there indefinitely. Not every individual is going to be a good choice for a child, but most individuals in these two species are docile and become quite tame with a little handling. They also eat (and therefore poop) infrequently, so cage cleaning is far less frequent than with something like a rat.",best pet for toddlers

Same part numbers as everyone else at MUCH lower prices.  We got our new set of kitchen appliances for 40% less than everyone else's sale prices.  No need to wait for holiday sales either.  Oh and free shipping and removal of the old appliances.

BTW: replacing the 20 year old electric appliances cut our electric bill in HALF!  Yes, over the same months...",best home improvement store

59196,"I'm still bummed that Clinique stopped making Happy to Be, but my go-to is the classic Happy. When I have it on, no one ever identifies it correctly; something in my body chemistry alters the scent. It ends up being unrecognizable, but soo summery and fun.

If you do go sampling a variety of fragrances, remember to bring a cup of black coffee or a small packet of coffee beans. Smell one, then smell the coffee. It helps cleanse your nose-palate (I'm sure there's a real word for it but oh well) so you can smell the next one more clearly.",best perfume

71063,"The Prestige. Fantastic film overall too.

Arrival. A perfect twist that doesn’t feel like a cheat but causes you to reevaluate everything you’ve seen.

Old boy. One of the most jaw dropping turns of recent years.

Memento. A modern classic for a reason - who thought that a film that goes in reverse could have a mega twist?

The Handmaiden. Genuinely couldn’t tell where the plot was going after the first 45 minutes or so.

Unbreakable. To me, even better than Sixth Sense!",best movies with a cool twist
36303,"Oh, I've tried plenty. Always open to recommendations btw. In terms of sheer taste, there are probably better ones out there. But part of what makes it the best for me is that it's such a tasty whiskey at a very affordable price point. Blanton's is good too, but $60+ dollars a bottle is roughly twice as expensive as ER10. 

Another great whiskey for the price is Wild Turkey 101. It's also far more available than ER10. Lots of people hear Wild Turkey and think it's some trashy swill, but they're wrong. I just see it as more for me.",best alcoholic drink
9704,"Third year here. My first year I was placed in San Nicolas Hall, on the 7th floor, ocean side. As far as views go, it was really hard to beat. I had a straight view to the pier and faced east so I got super amazing sunrises if I happened to wake up early enough.

San Nicolas has co-ed floors (as opposed to San Miguel), so that was really nice. All of the residence halls except for San Rafael have washer/dryer rooms inside the building itself.

I'd say the most important thing is don't feel like you have to stick around with your floor just because they're there. I found a better floor that my friend was living on and I had a much better time there.",best dorm hall at UCSB

24648,best anime,"How are you liking bleach so far? It would be easier to recommend a good anime if I know what you're into. Romance? Gore? Action? HunterxHunter, dead note, dead man wonderland and made in abyss are some good animes in my opinion, it's a good small list to start you off 👍 death note is on YouTube I believe."
41023,best instrument to play,"Harmonicas are relatively easy. They are all tuned to a key and if you can figure out how to tongue block and play one note at a time, you’re halfway to making it sound pretty good. There a big step between Bob Dylan and John Popper though."
39591,best podcast for biologists,"I actually happen to like Bostrom's writings on germline genome editing quite a bit, could you provide a link?"
1147,best ice cream flavor,I can't help it if I think you're funny when you're mad.
4974,best home improvement store,"I don't doubt that. 

The manager of the Home Depot store near me does a great job running his store, while Lowes seems like they just hired kids away from McDonald's, who have never held a hammer in their life. It's usually a waste of time for me to ask for help at my Lowe's store."
45671,best trick or treating candy,I enjoy it too - they taste like little dollops of icing.
45556,best gaming system,"I was just about to offer Mine!!
 Well, I do have an extra ps4 laying around......"
5650,best programming language for web development,"Same, such a joy to use. Pays well too"
5116,best home improvement store,"I never find myself in Lowes.
I prefer Home Depot over Lowes. Menards over both."
9741,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Any dorm on campus. I personally like Anacapa or Santa Cruz, then Santa Rosa and San Nic equally, then San Miguel"
32428,best vacation resort,"I chuckled at your ""notes"" descriptions. 

I have done a few tastings in France.  I would say their sommeliers or tasting technicians or whatever they are called are more pretentious than elsewhere. The wine tasting pourers on the wine trail in Michigan are hands down the most fun and least pretentious I have experienced anywhere in the world."
14666,best romantic novel,"I don't think I've read Heyer. If I have , she didn't stand out enough to me."

**Rogue Perfumery** *Tabac Vert*"
31075,best country to live in,"That gets thrown around a lot, but it's very hard to isolate any single cause to those patterns, so it may just be that it's not about increased freedom at all. The Scandinavian countries aren't without their own sets of norms and values either."
17777,best Kardashian,"I think people think kourtney is more down to earth and smart than she is because she looks the most natural. she has good aesthetic taste but she's the most superficial of all of them. in the same vein I think Kim gets judged as a ""bimbo"" unfairly because of the way she looks. people really hate on the ""diva"" thing.

I remember an snl sketch that called kourtney the ""smart"" one and thinking thats what you would assume if you hadn't watched the show. Kim is very very intelligent but people see her as an airhead."
12303,best gifts for dad,"I'm buying my Fiance a grill and possibly a bottle of bourbon.

I'm going to make him a card with our daughter's handprints and she is going to help me decorate it."
57542,best cologne,If you can try to get a sample but I highly recommend it. It’s a feel good fragrance definitely that’s why I think it’s such a compliment getter.
60274,best freezer brand,"Only 5-10 years?  Is this a more recent phenomenon?  That is, if I have appliances made 10+ years ago, should I hold on to them due to suddenly shorter life-spans in recent years?"
21765,best winnie the pooh comic,… you’re not wrong
4062,best online college,"The top of all time on AskReddit is 

""People who haven't pooped in 2019 yet, why are you still holding on to last years shit?"" here's a link for anyone curious https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/top/


... can anyone link me to the actual post since the above comment wasn't helpful?"
18974,best YouTube video,I guess you could say... Sam O'nella is at the academy?
39030,best web browser,"Microsoft Edge has done a lot of improvements on Chromium they haven’t pushed upstream yet. 

So Microsoft Edge might take the cake form un-googled chromium."
31429,best country to live in,"NEPAL! They have a saying ""tourist is God"" basically because most of their income as a nation comes from tourists, they are super nice and accommodating. And it's sooooo cheap. Eat local meals which are great and are like less than 2$."
11214,best backpack for college,"May I suggest a plain and simple pack from Roots ,the one i have is currently 6 years old and it only required a small amount of duck tape to repair a small patch where a textbook wore its way through over the course of 10 months."
31988,best hotel to live in,Oh did not know that

"Came here to say this. The characters are well written and storyline is rich, but it isn’t overwhelming if you haven’t played the prior two games."
"That’s about what mine was. Only lasted about 4 months before that started happening. What was worse with mine is after about a month or two, it got greasy and sticky. I avoid them now because of it. Could’ve been me, I have fairly oily skin, but it was just really gross"
"We've kept a little bit in contact via Twitter and such, but for the most part, nothing happened with that at all."

"That's really interesting, I used to subscribe to Her brains WebStorm but found that VSCode had all the features that I actually wanted and was a lot more efficient on runtimes. It also startups a lot quicker and with extensions is customised to my exact needs. 

Cancelled my subscription."
My suggestion is the Blade Itself trilogy by Joe Abercrombie. AMAZINGLY AWESOME CHARACTERS! And it is not your typical fantasy novel. There will be blood...

Chrome if you have more than 16 gigs of ram. But for real I use chrome just cuz i have always used it and don’t feel like dealing with Microsoft stuff. Honestly edge and chrome are probably equivalent though
Appreciate the help.
"Ah awesome! Okay I’d do a light grey. This way it gives you a lot to work with on the walls and you can incorporate any ‘cool’ colors you want / blue pallets. And can use accents color like yellow.  [this](https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/f4a1dfb602a9e1ca_4-0527/home-design.jpg) would look gorgeous, or even something like [this](https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/560c37dd7da26e3235ad995e/4:3/w_1200,h_900,c_limit/gray-living-room-01.jpg) with an accent wall. Either way, you’re gonna knock it out of the park with a space like that"

"Microwave an egg in a coffee cup. Make sure you cover it with a coffee filter or paper towel and don't cook too long or it'll explode all over the inside of your microwave. Toast an English muffin or bagel, put a slice of deli ham or turkey, the egg, a slice of cheddar cheese, some hot sauce or ketchup. Homemade breakfast sandwich in less than 5 minutes."
Yes! Same here with teaching. The only difference with the recipe is that we use Brandy here in good ol' Wisconsin.

"In Australia, electric blankets are usually the ones that go on your mattress like a mattress protector. Have you tried one of those? Electric throw blankets are also a thing and they're too easy to confuse by name, especially now I have both!"

If you are looking for lightweight, consider the XFCE desktop environment. This can be chosen on install if you use Debian or by downloading Xubuntu if you choose Ubuntu.

Your Desktop Environment (DE) will largely determine the look and feel of your Linux experience, but it also affects how much RAM you need. Cinnamon is based on the GNOME desktop, which is very beautiful and customizable, but it comes at a cost in memory usage. I've never seen a side-by-side comparison of XFCE vs. Cinnamon, but I know XFCE is much lighter than standard GNOME. I also think it's prettier than LXDE, the other leading lightweight DE.

I will also suggest that you don't need a long-term service version. I'm a relative newbie, too, and I thought that ""stable"" meant ""less likely to break"", but it's really more like ""unchanging"". If you use Ubuntu 20.04, you will basically be using versions of applications from late 2019 for the life of the release. New versions of Ubuntu come out every six months, and they will already have been tested for roughly six months at that point. They are very unlikely to have major bugs. It's also easy to upgrade from one version to the next.

So, my final recommendation is Xubuntu 21.04, then upgrade to 21.10 when it comes out next month. Lightweight, newbie-friendly, well supported, and reasonably up-to-date."

Just don't go for paperlike. I liked it at the beginning but after like a month/ month and half of using it with pencil the iPad became unusable as the foil became super scratched by the pencil. I had to replace the foil and looking forward to buy this one https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07QMV3Z87/ref=cm_cr_arp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8

"As a stay at home mom....a day to do what I want without interruption. For my birthday, from my mother, I got a voucher for a full day and night of babysitting. This was by far the best gift I got. But this is me. It depends on if she could be away from here baby for that long. I got that voucher when my babe has 6 months old and I used it. hoe this helps!"

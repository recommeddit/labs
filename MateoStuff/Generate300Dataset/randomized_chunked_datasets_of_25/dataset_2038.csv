50789,best rap album,"I'm a big fan of Czar and the project felt very rushed together to me. Particularly, I thought the production was just OK in comparison compared to the last one they did along with the overall chemistry.

Deck was a weak point for me, and I like Eso but he doesn't do enough for me to carry a track himself most of the time. I think the bar set by their past work is what gets me though. It's not bad, I just have little desire to replay it when I feel their 2013-2018 stuff does the zany comic book rap style better for me."
30623,best Mexican war to study,">No they didn't. They maintained the blockade until the end of the war. And their blockade was just as illegal

It was a violation of the US's neutral rights, but the British weren't the ones killing American citizens and destroying their property. That was Germany.

>not really. the deal was that IF the US declared war then Germany would make an alliance with Mexico.

In other words they tried to entice a war between the US/Mexico, as the Germans were aware that they were annoying the US quite a bit with their use of submarines."

13790,best research paper archive,"Thanks, that was interesting. A bit uncomfortable, given how much justification he felt he had to do about the 'data stealing' question. Clearly still defensive about it 50 years later!

He says at 38 mins in (IIRC) that the RNA thing was a mistake, and that it would only have been slightly different."

10979,best backpack for college,"I've been using the North Face Jester ever since my Herschel broke. I'm a university student who commutes to school on a motorcycle and it's perfect for my needs.

I usually have a 13 inch laptop, a few A5 notebooks/binded notes/folder and a 1l Nalgene bottle in the main compartment. Small miscellaneous stuff in the small one. I love that the small pocket has mini compartments so I can organise my stuff. Been using the bag for a year or so and it hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear. The back is nicely cushioned too, and the black matched with everything. So I'd say go for it!"

47230,best state to visit in the United States,"If you want one of the best football experiences I'd say go to Seattle, WA.  Their fans aren't called ""The Twelfth Man"" for nothing. It's a blast.  I went there to visit my grandparents and it's a really cool place too. Lots of cool stuff, the Space Needle being one of the big ones.  It's also not going to cost you an arm and a leg like CA or NYC."
1084,best ice cream flavor,"Imagine Chocolate chip, but the chocolate is drizzled into the ice cream, so it like like elongated drops.  It's a wonderful flavor of gelato (which is not ice cream)."
29328,best game console,Well I'm still waiting for the ps5 and Xbox series x or whatever Microsoft is calling it. There is one game that is only worth for me to get Sony and that is god of war but sadly Sony doesn't support backwards comparability that's such a dick move. How far back is Xbox game comparability.

10708,best suitcase lock,"For a carry on? Doesn't really matter. Someone can pop the zipper with a pen and they're in. For checked? Depends, are you traveling domestically and want to travel with a firearm? Then you can use an actual hard sided case with an actual lock, otherwise, again it doesn't matter because you can only use a TSA lock."
57854,best cologne,"Women seem to always like the colognes that smell like food. Hints of vanilla, or fruity smells. So things like Fahrenheit and Joop tend to be popular. I myself HATE smelling fruity or like food, so I tend to go for Cartier or even CK One..and then get no compiments."

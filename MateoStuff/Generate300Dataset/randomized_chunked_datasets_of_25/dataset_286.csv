4299,best text editor,"For programming, it's not just about an editor. Bash and Linux tools can be extremely useful in conjunction with your editor: grep, awk, sed, find, ls, ctags, etc.

What I often discover with Windows text editors is there is a specific feature I wish it had so that I could do some laborious, repetitive process very quickly. Using a shell with an editor in Linux, it's not a matter of wishing a feature exists - because **there is always a way to do it.** It's just a matter of finding out how."
73279,best Linux distro,"Do yourself a favor, OP, and just stick with Linux Mint.  Cinnamon is gorgeous and very Windows-esque, it has stable updates with its Long-Term Support (LTS), and it's based on Ubuntu. That means you'll get access to the largest software repositories that any distro has to offer. If you're a student, and you don't *NEED* MS Office or Adobe products, then Linux Mint should carry you through school. LibreOffice is brilliant for writing papers.

Then you have Lutris and PlayOnLinux in case you need a Windows ("".exe"") program to run on Linux (admittedly, this is a swing or miss; check the POL/WineHQ database to see what works or not)."
33116,best energy drink,"When I used energy drinks, I really liked Monster KHAOS. 

Caffeine makes me too anxious, and the crash hits me hard. I feel better without the stuff. I still drink soda a few times a month."

7770,best laptop for general use,"Actually, I think I know what the answer is. The new Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 14"" might just be the best 14"" laptop on the market. I've reviewed the IdeaPad 5 14"" myself (non-Pro version) and it handles its thermals pretty well. This new model is going to come with a Ryzen 5000 processor, up to MX450 graphics, 16 GB RAM, up to a 1 TB SSD, and most surprisingly, a QHD 90Hz 16:10 350 nit display.

42166,movies like Inception,"There is [Paprika](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paprika?from=Main.Paprika), which is said to have inspired Inception. I didn't enjoy it, but many people do. As for films that riase questions about the validity of the protagonist's view of reality, I can recommend Blade Runner, Black Swan, Total Recall, Shutter Island, and the Truman Show. I'm sure there are many others, but most of these movies are pretty good (I didn't like Shutter Island, but that may have just been me). This is a good list to start with.

[Blade Runner](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner), which has a [92%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner/) on Rotten Tomatoes. 

[Black Swan](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan?from=Main.BlackSwan), which has an [87%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_swan_2010/).

[Total Recall](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990), which has an [84%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall/).

[Shutter Island](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutterIsland), which has a [69%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1198124-shutter_island/).

[Truman Show](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTrumanShow?from=Main.TheTrumanShow), which has a [95%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/truman_show/).

As much as I would like the stronger CPU, more RAM, and more storage a 13' is too small. Do you think the 14' is a bad package?"

- Containing fluoride (>1000ppm for adults) is important.
- Brush for a full two-three minutes (no point making your gums bleed).

Thanks, doc👍"

51527,best iphone case,"Yes, the totally clear one yellowed on the sides after a couple of months. But I have one that's black around the edges now (my iPhone SE is black as well, so it blends seamlessly), and I haven't had that issue. Just don't buy the totally clear one. The black one is still clear on the back for maximum brand visibility and dick measuring.

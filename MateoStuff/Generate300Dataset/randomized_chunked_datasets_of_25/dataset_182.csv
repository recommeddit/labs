10. *Incandescence* by Greg Egan

Ask me tomorrow and the order and list will likely change. I would also add, I refrained from putting books that are parts of an ordered series on the list. The entire Culture series by Ian M. Bank is phenomenal. Each book in the series can be read separately in any order. There are several series that when taken on whole, including the novels, novellas, and compilations are excellent:

* The Revelation Space series by Alastair Reynolds
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey
* The Xeelee sequence by Stephen Baxter
* The Nexus trilogy by Ramez Naam"
67765,axios alternatives reddit,"> HTTP response that has been parsed to a friendly JS object from the JSON string. 

I don't understand this, and it's tripped me up with axios, and also on a PHP library that does web requests too.

Generally speaking, it's horrible to use the same variable for two different things, and especially for two different types (string vs object).  

> This reduces the number of repetitive tasks that you have to do (manually parse JSON like in Fetch)

But it doesn't... it actually creates a bunch more work.  Now I need to write conditional code for every web request to determine whether `response.data` is a string or an object, and then write even more code to account for dealing with both data types.  You can't rely on an external server always succeeding and returning exactly what you were expecting.

The developer is expecting to either operate on string or an object, so why wouldn't `response.data` just stay consistently as a string, and have a method like `response.dataAsObject()` to return it as an object?  It's not more work for the developer, and it means the library behaves in a consistent way.

Please let me know if I misunderstood something, but this ""it saves work"" point just seems completely the opposite to me.  And it's caused multiple problems for me, and many many others from everything I see online about it."

... It's time to eat now :)"

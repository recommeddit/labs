Personally, considering the battery backup feature is only with the highest end Lightning package (which is like $90k+), I'd rather get a cheaper Lightning, and buy an actual battery backup for home solar which will work 24/7 and allow me to drive my truck whenever."
21663,best winnie the pooh comic,"Haha, yep.  Still bummin' around reddit."
60448,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I find her character hard to watch - or listen to, really. So OTT that it' s like nails on a chalk

70219,best major to study in college,"Same. I work as a data analyst for a very large company and I do some programming and database design. While I got zilch of these actual skills from my time at college and grad school, I directly credit studying logic and argumentation in philosophy and theology courses that caused me to be good at what I do.  I can analyze the shit out of stuff and come up with solutions.  Studying ancient languages such as Greek and Latin only helped me quickly pick up the semantics of programming.  If you are intelligent, transformable and can demonstrate this to a prospective company, they'll consider you."

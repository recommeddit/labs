But Brady hasn’t been included in the 2021 list yet
"Doesn’t look like it, Busch gardens is owned by Seaworld, and i don’t think it would be the most popular anywhere anyway."
Dish eshplainsh a lot
Visual Studio Code is cross platform and open source. You are probably mixing it up with Visual Studio. Vs Code is basically just a faster Atom
"It seems like most quick breakfast foods are sweet.  Most flavored oatmeals, cereals, yogurt, fruit--all of it is sweet.  I hate eating sweet things for breakfast, but do it anyway because that's what is quick and fairly healthy. Maybe this is a good alternative that definitely could be made in a (somewhat) healthy way.

If you didn't want to make the batter, you could use pre-made pie crusts, though that might get expensive if you're making enough for a month."
Surprised to see Hellsing as the runner up and not Hellsing Ultimate. I always got the impression the original was not especially liked
"Played Dark Souls or Bloodborne? Not open world, but they have great level design and damn rewarding gameplay once you get the hang of things."
"I had the pleasure of meeting both Paramore and Steps (if anyone still remembers them, I was like 12 at the time). 2 best days of my life (so far) probably.

Most friendly man among those, Taylor York. 
He showed alot of interest in the conversation, and probably asked us more questions about our lives, than we did about his."
Is it related to Gino's in Buellton? By far the best pizza in the SYV.

"Vodka in fruit punch if I'm at home and want to blow an evening, or an IPA-style beer of my choice."
Colombo is my all time favorite!
"I really enjoyed “For Ya”, ”Goteo”, & “I Love Her” off her album.  I could definitely see her doing really well w/ the standouts on here.  

For me personally if I could pick, I’d really wanna hear a lowkey more off-kilter EP from her cause I like a lotta the elements she got.  Those can end up way better than whole albums for me w/ some artists like Ravyn Lenae, who I love & she’s only released EPs, no debut album yet."
"This table is awesome! If I may make a request for future revisions, could you try to keep the Data all in Gigabytes (i.e. 500MB->0.5, 2GB->2, etc.)? I think this may help the table sort a bit better when you're sorting by data, because right now, 2.5 comes before 2, and 100 MB comes after almost everything else.

Short of that nitpick, this is awesome! Totally gliding this 🙂"
"Hell, I remember it being good in the early 2000's. It probably changed a little more than a decade ago. I also remember that their bottles became way thinner and flimsier."

"Dune, Footfall, Desolation Road"
"Ranger is a beast, vim like commands"
"note, cooling not included there. the 12600k will need a beefy one, pushing it at least 50$ up."
It's a wonderful time to be entering the fast paced field of teledildonics
Get the hd560s. Or pc38x for pure gaming performance. DT990 can hurt for a lot of people due to the piercing treble. Both of the options mentioned can be ran off mobo audio or through the apple dongle.
"Hi, I'm looking for a laptop that can be used for mid photo/video editing. My budget is around $600. It will also be used for school purposes."

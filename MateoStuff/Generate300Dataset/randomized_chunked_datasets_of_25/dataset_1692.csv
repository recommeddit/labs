41088,"I took up guitar because I needed something to relax with after violin practice.  It became my primary.  I took up the uke because of Amanda Palmer and Grace Vanderwall. 

Uke is easy because it’s fun. 

To me the easiest instrument to play is the one you’ve learned to enjoy practicing on.  If practice is enjoyable and we keep the instrument ready to hand, then things become easy.  I’ve spent enough time with a guitar that the uke was just a 3 stringed guitar with an extra weird string. Everything already “worked” 

To me, what is easy is that which is enjoyable.  Technical difficulty only creates practice difficulty when it is frustrating. Ymmv",best instrument to play

33628,"Almost any EV will work for your use case. I'm on my second Spark EV (first was a lease) and they've been great. If you can find a 2016 or newer Leaf they have the larger battery. I'd avoid Fiat because Fiat and also these are very small (coming from a Spark EV driver, I know small when I see it). BMW i3 with or without REX. If you don't need it, the REX apparently is the main thing that breaks on those cars. Bolt is another possibility, but costs more.

Get a 240V level 2 charger, at least 25 amps. You don't need it immediately as you can get by with 120V level 1, but you will like it better on days when you were out late the night before and have to leave early. Also, charging at 240V uses less electricity than 120V because there are some fixed losses in the process and the 240V has more left over to actually go into the battery.",best electric car
2530,"JVC Etremes. I went on Amazon when I wanted to buy a new pair of earphones, sorted by 'top rated' at the time. These come top out of around 5000 listings. I always assumed JVC to be a crappy brand til I got these I love them! I love electro music and they blast so much bass. On sale for around £12 aswell! Great value.

40953,"Interesting. I play mostly in the rock world but am influenced a lot by folk and Brazilian music, and I play with a drummer who is very well-versed in Brazilian percussion, so I've been able to see what separates good drummers from bad ones. Part of it for him is the technique, as you state: he's an expert at getting different sounds by using different sticks, different parts of the drum, etc. Part of it is that he's a master at so many things, able to play not just a drum set but all different types of hand drums, shakers, tambourines, etc., often multiple things at the same time.

> Many, if not most, can play at accurate tempos from memory; for example, if you want me to play 112bpm, I can with no count, and it won’t be 111 or 113.

Interesting. How do people train and develop this skill?",best instrument to play
6645,"The problem with Android is that most vendors are crap at long term software support. I say this as someone who always uses Android too. With Android you're lucky if your vendor gives you 3 years of new updates, with Apple you get like 5 years. It can be difficult to recommend that to people that want to keep their phone a very long time unless they're comfortable installing custom ROMs to maintain the latest software versions. The issue isn't so bad anymore because Google delivers many parts of the OS via the play store now but I'm still very sceptical. I had my OnePlus One for 6 years because of custom ROMs, and I've just bought a new phone a few months ago but I'm sceptical how long it will really last without me installing a custom ROM in a couple years.",best iPhone

Spider-Man 2 did the best job at showing this and it did a great job of showing why he’s such a relatable character with his own struggles like all of us. Tom is well on his way to being a great character on his own without all the Iron Man tech and tying Tobey for my favorite live action version of Spidey.,best spiderman actor

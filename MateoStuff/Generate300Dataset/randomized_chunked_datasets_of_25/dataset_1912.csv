46031,best trick or treating candy,"Correct, I give out a lot, but want to have the good stuff for leftovers"
47410,best state to visit in the United States,"Yes! My family visited Phoenix in August and we decided to go hiking midday. The people working at our hotel basically begged us not to go out. We brought a ridiculous amount of Gatorade and water, and finished it all in record time. But the view from where we hiked was breathtaking.

As a snake lover, I was sorely disappointed I didn't see any rattlesnakes. Our desert guide told me to come back in the cooler months if I expected to see any!"
57780,best cologne,"You can wear Aventus anytime, anywhere. I would wear it casually and feel like a badass, on a date, in a suit, in jeans, whatever. It's very versatile."
29424,best game console,"* NES: Mike's Tyson Punch Out!!
* PC: Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast
* N64: Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
* PS2: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater

41429,best instrument to play,"One of my classmates was a voice major who–in his first keyboard class–had to be shown where middle C was.

By the end of the first semester, he was playing the first Chopin Nocturne amazingly well. Everyone was floored by his progress. 

So I think he means you get what you put in."
19456,best YouTube video,The entire Hermitcraft sever are really cool
65521,best phone service company,"McGuire: AT&T or Verizon. T-Mobile and Sprint suck out in the sticks. That being said, if you live off base and dont mind missing out on signal at work, any work pretty well. Being between Philly and NYC help with that."
58458,best cologne,"TBQH I think for the younger male, wearing cologne is out. If you must wear it, use very, very little. I like Polo Blue and Armani Black. I've had a lot of girls really compliment both, particularly the former."
35333,best alcoholic drink,"Seriously? That sucks, I heard about the “death” of pioneer square but walingford? Guess the pre-recession Seattle of My memories and dreams is a different place today. Sucks to hear."
16552,best pet for toddlers,An ant farm?
17824,best Kardashian,"1. Khloe is funny, consistently entertaining, and genuinely cares about her family. She also seems to have more real confidence in who she is, like she has an actual personality that she’s not afraid to show. She can do much better than Tristan and I hope she will.
2. Kourtney seems down-to-earth and like she has a good head on her shoulders, even if that makes her annoying sometimes. If I could be friends with any of them, it would probably her her. 
3. Kris gives me mixed feelings because I feel like she exploited the Jenner kids before they could really consent, but also, they are rich because of her, so 🤷🏼‍♀️
4. Scott, like Khloe, is always good TV and I feel for his issues. I am really glad he seems to have pulled himself out of the alcoholism for a bit.
5. Kylie has no personality but, as with Kendall, I feel like I’d be equally anxious and guarded if raised on TV
6. Kendall for the same reason as above. Loses points for faux-wokeness.
7. I waver on Kim, but right now she’s not on my good list. Needs to find herself. 
8. Caitlin was a good dad, but I think her lifelong struggle with her identity caused some mental health issues that have resulted in a toxic person.
9. Kanye, as I’ve mentioned somewhere else, I think is not doing Kim any favors. Apologies to fans here but I think his lyrics about his daughters were creepy af, he treats Kim like a Barbie doll for him to play with, whines about the tortures of monogamy, and I’m over it. 
10. Rob is a MESS and his sock line is bad. I hope he gets help."
52540,best hiphop album,Liquid Swords is IMO the greatest hip hop album of all time.
22703,best celebrity,"If I see this guy, I'm totally not gonna ask for his autograph."
63760,best books for building better habits reddit,"I'm familiar with BJ Fogg. His lectures online have helped me do 20-30 pull-ups everyday (I do them after I use the bathroom lol.) 

And I agree completely. Figuring out what it is you want to commit your life too, that is where the real power is, but so far I haven't found a good way to articulate how one can discover their Life's Purpose. But I'm working on it. 

The Artist's Way and The ONE Thing are books that have helped me, but personally, nothing has been more powerful than a responsibly conducted psychedelic experience."
17769,best Kardashian,"Oh haha, i don't know sometimes people rip your head off here. I try to give my opinion as nice as i can 😂"
7816,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I am looking for a laptop under $600 just for general use, not gaming, would prefer 500GB+ storage (ssd/hdd) but not a must. Was looking at the vivobook and aspire 5 paired with a mid-range CPU like i5/ryzen 5 but not sure which is better, if any. Mainly looking for the most bang for the buck and good durability/quality, so I am open any recommendations. Preferably not Lenovo/chromebook though. Thanks."

Style aside they are the most comfortable pair of sunglasses I've owned, and I wear sunglasses 8 hours a day while working."
54147,best medicine for a cold,Take a cold egg out of the fridge and have your local shaman remove the bad spirits in your body by rubbing the egg all over your skin.  Only when you break the egg and you can see the little black specs of your illness in the yolk will you feel better.
9591,best toothpaste,"Worked in a dental office as for brand we carried crest 3d I tried using it I did notice a slight improvement in whiteness.

"You're role playing as Geralt, no where in the RPG commandments does it list that you have to be able to be an Archer or mage for a game to be an RPG.

Also technically doing a signs build is a ""mage"" build"
"[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) is basically this. Yes, it's set in space and all, but it's more of a humorous adventure novel than a sci-fi novel. I think it can appeal to almost anyone. You'll especially appreciate the early chapters.

Another great option is [The Sot-Weed Factor](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24835.The_Sot_Weed_Factor). A very funny ""history"" novel, and you'll never look at the early Pilgrims the same way again.

Also try [If on a Winter's Night a Traveler](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/374233.If_on_a_Winter_s_Night_a_Traveler) and [A Wild Sheep Chase](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11298.A_Wild_Sheep_Chase). They are wonderful."
"Azure Dreams, good game, I never beat it but I remember going up that tower a lot and getting different pets or something if I recall correctly?"
"Out of curiosity how much did you pay?

I remember like 5 years ago they were going for like 50$

If never played Xbox 360 then fuck yeah your gonna have a good time for super cheap lol almost all Xbox 360 games are 5$ at game stores, hell even brand new they’re dirt cheap"
"Understanding what I was talking about might be a bit difficult, because I now realize I missed your point ;-)"
Agreed and now I'm at where I hate being and why I usually don't watch shows until they end... Waiting for a new season!

Yeah that I can understand. VMWare Player is only barely powerful enough on my laptop to run Fusion 360.

No. But she prefers unperfumed men. I think she sees perfume as feminine. As for her being a guy...? Don't guys prefer perfume on women? I do. To each their own I guess.

"Every time I think of oatmeal I'm like ""mmm, that actually sounds good. I haven't had that in forever"", and then I make some and it tastes like shit. I need to dump all kinds of shit into it to make sure it doesn't taste like soggy cardboard."
"Hmm Armor by John Steakley is good.

Strange that there wasn't a mention of Ringworld."
"If I understood correctly its more about the desktop and help files of the Distro than the actual distro itself.

 Of course it should be one .iso File, burn it to a USB stick with rufus (from windows, dont know equivalent in Linux yet), start it, install it, ready. Not something where you have to pick everything yourself.

I liked Linux Mint but it just crahed two times and I had to solve it with a reboot. I recommend the KDE desktop, its the most similar to Windows, beautiful and includes some useful tools and the ability to theme and change everything really well.

Atm I use MXLinux, before tried Mint and manjaro but manjaro has a divided reputation. It is based on Debian (the origin distro of many) and is pretty popular, without a company behind it. The KDE version is pretty new and there is only one type, but its the newest supporting new hardware."

"The active ingredients can differ. Stannous fluoride has been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride. [PDF source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1951625/pdf/pubhealthreporig00021-0087.pdf). Other toothpastes use sodium monofluorophosphate as their fluoride providing ingredient. You may notice some correlation between price and active ingredient, but it seems it mostly comes down to the marketing of the inactive ingredients. 

Here's a short list of some popular products and their active ingredient:

**Sodium Fluoride**: (most common)

* Aquafresh Ultimate White, Extreme Clean, etc.
* Rembrandt Intense Stain
* Crest (regular), Tartar protection, Crest Complete
* Colgate Triple Action, Colgate Total (also has triclosan)
* Aim
* Gleem
* Arm & Hammer
* Mentadent
* Sensodyne (also has Potassium Nitrate)

**Stannous Fluoride**:

* Crest ProHealth

**Sodium Monofluorophosphate**:

* Tom's of Maine Whole Care, Clean & Gentle, etc.
* Rembrandt Deeply White
* Aquafresh Cavity Protection
* Colgate Cavity Protection, Colgate Whitening Baking Soda

Note: I'm not a dentist nor toothpaste specialist or anything like that. I don't work for or have any affiliation with any company that does anything with teeth or toothpaste. Active ingredients were pulled from the listings on drugstore.com."

"What about mouth wash? If toothpaste make little difference, one wonders if mouthwash isn't a total scam."
"Not sure if its considered ""the best"" but I love the bezel and overall look of the [Acer R240HY](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-R240HY-bidx-23-8-Inch-Widescreen/dp/B0148NNKTC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468259646&sr=8-1&keywords=acer+r240hy)"
My dentist's father's brother had a wife who was a dentist. After retiring she never used flouride toothpaste again.

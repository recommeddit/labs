32535,best vacation resort,Check out pueblo bonito sunset beach in cabo. It's on the other  side if the arch and away from the touristy area. It was very nice and romantic built into the side of a cliff with big rooms and great views. There is also another attached resort that is adults only and another that has 3 bedroom houses for rent for 300/night. We got it as a mystery hotel for 200/night all inclusive for 2
43584,best items under $100,I was reading this and I was thinking if it’s detachable how the fuck does the water get to it? I realised on reading further and thinking rationally that this is pretty much the standard shower head on a hose that we get in the UK. Didn’t realise fixed shower heads were the standard elsewhere
23492,best car racing video game,In Wreckfest you start with a good car and turn it into a crappy one.
71118,best movies with a cool twist,"Yep I think that's why the ending still lands despite almost everyone having seen the iconic beach image. It's not just a ""gotcha!"" ending, it comes after the reveal of why ""The Forbidden Zone"" is restricted, Dr Zaius's cover up, and the implication of what mankind had done. So bleak."
65654,best phone service company,"I'm enjoying the iPad plan via ATT, it's really unlimited... I would not recommend red pocket, their data runs out very fast compared to others"
27318,best stocks to buy,"Worst is that it was rough only because apparently investors can’t read ER and only focus on estimated and reported EPS. They missed the estimates by so much because it included massive one-time expense which was Galileo acquisition. Investors panicked, but there is nothing wrong with the company, and number of new clients rose steeply again, which is whats important for growth stock."

47307,best state to visit in the United States,"If you want to visit the South, I'd recommend Atlanta. I was there five years ago or so, and I really loved it. The food was amazing (please send Peach cobbler) and for a US city, there's a lot of history to discover as well. Many people rip on it, but I loved it, even the coke museum. Then again, we stayed with some great people and they went to great lengths to show us around."
32315,best hotel to live in,"DUDE.

I was at a hawaiian hotel luau where they served rolls with those butter balls. I'm first in line looking at the food labels first, then the food. Then I see some puffed up name for rolls like ""Hawaiian Super Rolls"" or something. Next to the label were the little butter balls. I'm thinking ""OH SWEET! Some sorta tiny, fancy, shiny rolls. All about it."" And I grab like 10.

Then one of the hosts sees and exclaims, ""Ohhh, BUTTER MAN!!"" and then I look up and see some basic rolls in a basket just next to me. Fuck. I'm already 10 butters in and only want 1 real roll. I can't put them back, I can't let him know I'm am idiot. Gotta let him believe I'm eating just as much butter as bread my whole life."
72196,best movies with a cool twist,Saw I has just the most insane twist.
67371,axios alternatives reddit,"If you have to rely on a 3rd party library to make requests I'm sorry but you need to learn how to use `fetch`.  Way too many enterprise companies write wrappers around `fetch` to adapt it to their needs and if you don't know how to use `fetch`, you won't know how to use their wrapper effectively.In reality even if you do prefer a 3rd party solution, I'd like to remind you that understanding where an abstraction comes from only helps you better understand the abstraction.

`fetch` is native, learn how to use."

"This probably isn't the answer you were looking for but from the minimal searching I've done there is really nothing that stood out.

If you are just looking for something to kill time and learn a thing or two about biology what you maybe interested in is reading. 

try reading Charles Darwin origin of species or other authors like; Richard Dawkins, Bill Bryson"
Just gpu.
So saddened that Empire and Psycho are hurried in this thread. Get off my lawn with your torture porn

•Beyond the Aquila Rift by Alastair Reynolds

•Glory Season by David Brin

Reasons: the scope and ideas behind the first four made my head spin and the fifth one has extremely interesting storyline I enjoyed immensely.

Edit: formatting."
We have similar taste in books! Do you have other recs?
Did you use them as just search terms or pick the “amusement park” label for all of them? I’m having issues with Great Escape bc it’s showing no volume in Vermont when I select it as an amusement park. Santa’s Village seems the most searched in Vermont
"I can relate to how you feel, was a dropout for 4-5 years and it set me back. If I stayed in school i’d have my degree by now and be in law school, but at the same time my grades probably wouldn’t have been good if I stayed in school."
"Oh nice, can I ask some of your faves because I might like them and am just interested anyway?"

Dude... Uncool
Home depot. 1.5 miles from my home. I can go there and back super fast.
"I would go back and skip college. Five years I could have been gathering work experience, wasted. I didn't even get to party or fuck chicks so yeah... wasted 5 years."
Surprised waffles isn't in this breakfast.
"i worked night audit for awhile, and had one dude call a hooker, enjoy her services, and then refuse to pay her.

she came to me, said she’d been raped, so i call the cops. dude gets rousted from bed at 3 am to talk to the cops in the lobby.

the whole time she’s yelling, “if you need a dna sample i’ve got some in my mouth,” the cops are trying to explain to the guy that his options are paying her or going to jail for rape and solicitation, and i’m trying to use my best customer service skills to keep everyone quiet and gently hint to the dude where the ATM is.

the best part was, this was night 1 of a week-long stay, so i got to see him every day after that."
"FFXV is a mixed bag to be honest. It gets alot of (understandable) hate but it's nowhere near the worst game ever. A few things I will tell you is that the combat is a mess and doesn't even reach the standard for an action game, and I'm not joking, the story basically doesn't exist, heavy bold on ""basically"", the large open world is mostly bare as hell, and even on a disc the game takes up OVER 60GB, almost as much as FFXIV which actually makes sense to eat up so much space as it's an MMO that constantly gets updated and has way way more to do than XV does.

I enjoyed the game while I was playing through it (the story and chapter 13 pre-fix aside), but I can't bring myself to touch the game ever again. Redownloaded it twice within a week and just deleted it both times. The combat, especially for an action game, just makes it unbearable to go back to alone, which is all there is to go back to really.

Get it on sale/when you have more money than you know what to do with, or don't get it at all."
ENOUGH 😭😭💀💀
Do you know which store sells those?

Yeah I work in IT helping mostly elderly clients and it can be a lot easier for them to reinforce concepts if you send them home with easy instructionals
"That makes sense. We handle retries through our own custom code, which is why I’ve never run into that before.

Good to know!"
Look for a Logitech C615 it's the same thing just not 60fps
My mom would love the peas in a pod necklace. She loves jewelry with all her kids represented but it's harder to find for 5 kids vs 2-3.
Have you thought about taking out loans to cover the difference? I know it’s not ideal but at least you’d get the degree you want
He meant a Switch Tester. You can buy them off Amazon for under $20. Look for the 6-key Switch Tester by WASD Keyboards.

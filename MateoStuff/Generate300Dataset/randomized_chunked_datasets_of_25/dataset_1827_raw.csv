Always nice to see some love for Terranigma. That game was so ahead of it's time and doesn't get enough appreciation
"I never should have joined sprint. Canceling my service was like trying to take a steak away from a Rottweiler. (,Edit from I'll never go back to sprint.)"
"Assuming they are American. Canadian schools also have a lot of online options such as UManitoba, TRU, Athabasca and Laurentian."
The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin is good.
"I hoped I was safe here, I thought you'd only corrupted Facebook...
None the less it is good to see you Nelly"
"First, I wouldn't call Assassin's Creed an RPG, unless you really twist the genre.

That said, here are the titles I recommend:

* MMO:
   * Final Fantasy XIV
* Offline, GCD-based:
   * Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age
   * The Witcher III: Wild Hunt Complete Edition
* Offline, turn-based:
   * Child of Light
   * Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age
   * Final Fantasy X
   * I Am Setsuna
   * The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel I & II (don't play or even buy II until after you've finished I)
   * Persona 5"

"Please don’t be so quick to blame ‘lazy doctors.’ My co-worker had a medical board complaint filed against her because she didn’t give a child with sniffles for 2 days a script for amoxicillin. Antibiotic overuse and  resistance is driven in large part by patients. Sure the prescriber should be firm, but I’ve had shorter visits for mild heart failure and pneumonia than for explaining to a patient why they didn't need levaquin “which always works for them” for their nasal congestion they developed as they were driving by the clinic. I’ve luckily been mostly successful in explaining why antibiotics aren’t necessary but public education needs to carry some of the load."
"Just remember guys, you can save on used monitors more than most other computer parts. Once people don't want a monitor, it's a big and bulky item to put up with, so fast sales are usually desirable.

I bought my £1000 monitor for £300 5 years ago.

The average 1440p 144hz used price in UK is £220."
"Man me and you would get along. 

Fab is top 5 for me DOA. Jim Jones second chapter of his career has been better than his first, kinda like Boosie after prison. 

Styles P has done a good job too with his newer music.

Dave East has made excellent projects almost 8 years straight. Still kinda crazy to me he isn’t more famous. But that’s how it goes."
"And six of them are from Phase 3

Which goes to show how big of an improvement Phase 3 really is."
"No, no, no, you're confused. Pooh comes OUT of an asshole."
I don't think I've ever met anyone else who likes them.... :( MORE FOR ME!
"I think wolf children and usagi drop can both probably be good for people that don't like anime, specifically grills. Not that I think grills will like them more than boys but rather grills seem less likely to like other anime stuff"
"It isn't an exact recipe but here goes.

Start with a one quart mason jar. Use canning funnel kind of like this.

Then add instant oats about halfway, dry milk to the 2/3 mark, a dash of sugar, and then a bunch of raisins--leave about 10% space at the top. Lastly add cinnamon and dry vanilla powder to taste plus a pinch of salt.

Then cap and shake until it's well mixed. Store on a shelf and shake out a little into a bowl each day at breakfast. Add boiling water. By the time a coffee press is ready the oatmeal is also ready to eat. One batch lasts me 7 days."
Boltdepot for specialized bolts.
Which is why you pick the paint first but paint the room itself last.
"Terry Pratchett was as quirky and fun in real life as his books were.  His passing was a huge loss to me as we'd met several times in person and had multiple conversations online.  Felt like I'd lost a friend.

We met Robin Williams at Universal Studios when my wife's Grandmother was still alive.  She said hello to him and hoped his family was having a good time.  He tipped his hat to her and said ""Thank you kindly, Ma'am"".  She talked about that encounter the rest of her days.  In real life he was super short as well.

And, finally, Tim Hunkin who you've probably never heard of but he did a popular TV show in the 90s called The Secret Life of Machines.  I sent him an e-mail thanking him for helping me become interested in electronics and I got a very kind reply back."
Safety razor. $20 chrome handle has saved me $100s in blades over the last 12 years.

-
Nurse Jackie
McMafia 
Morning Show
Big Little Lies
Your Honor - 2021 Brian Cranson (there are a few shows with the same name)
Chicago Fire 
Chicago PD, almost as good as NYPD Blue 

Im currently watching Snowfall. Excellent show, About the drug world in the 80's in LA.
 Enjoy😉"
"One of my favorite sayings is that it takes 10 years to be bad at the violin. That's, of course, due to the relative difficulty of playing in tune.

As others have said, your aptitude combined with effort will determine how objectively good you are. Subjectively, you have to decide what you consider good."
">Perhaps there are loads of them who get stuck in these roles/images which are not at all reflective of their actual nature, simply due to the fact that they are forced to make a viable career out of what they have chosen to do.

Well, that's wrestling, isn't it? Obviously, not all these guys are really arrogant douches in real life (although I am sure that some may be) - and even the ones that keep up their appearances off-screen probably do so for the sake of professionalism."
"Best: Cherry Blasters or Crispy Crunch bars.

Worst: candy corn and molasses kisses."

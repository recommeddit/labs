"Honestly, I'd go even further, you don't need a webcam at all. There is nothing that turns people away from a stream faster than bad audio and everyone would be better off investing in a microphone."

"I learned the answer is Pop-tarts.

One Halloween, I completely forgot about getting candy so when trick-or-treaters arrived, I gave them what I had in my pantry and I have never seen kids smile as widely before or since. That was also the first Halloween where they actually yelled in excitement when they saw what I was handing out."
"I’m 1000% with you. I’ve had a chair in my shower for only a couple months and it makes everything easier. I also feel like I can sit in the shower and really REALLY tend to my feet without fear of slipping, falling, and dying lol

Edit: missed a word :)"

"I'm still not sure if it's as smart as it appears to be, but I can't be bothered to watch it again.  One of the better attempts at time travel, but I feel like it's missing useful information that would make it a lot simpler (like Donnie darko)."

Except SEAS had a lot of rough years this decade because of Blackfish. They are bouncing back though which is good and 2020 will be very telling of how next decade will go.
"Oh man, great question. I often think in analogies: If psychology was a human body, in which theories and constructs (I.e. depression, intimacy, cognitive dissonance) are muscle & fat, then statistics and experimental design are it's the skeleton. If you see yourself as a scientist and want to go to graduate school to conduct research, you need to have a more than adequate grasp of statistics. They are what make Psychology a science. I could probably write several paragraphs about their codependency.   
If you're a freshman, you’ve got Stats for Psychology & Experimental Methods on your course horizon. These are the most important classes you can take if you want to go to graduate school."
"Nope. Hutson played 7 seasons before the US entered WWII. He led the league in receptions four times, yards four times, and touchdowns six times.

He was getting more receiving touchdowns than entire other teams, and he was doing it at a time when teams couldn't even complete 40% of their passes."

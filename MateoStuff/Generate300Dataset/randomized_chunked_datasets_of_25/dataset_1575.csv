30025,best money managing app,"I've used money manager for 7mos but it betrayed me. :( I turned on the daily backup but, when my phone was accidentally wiped, I discovered the app hasn't been backing up my files for the last 3mos."
20783,best workout music,Eye of the tiger- Survivor
54904,best water filter,http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/michael_pritchard_invents_a_water_filter.html
56797,best desktop monitor,"What's the refresh rate on that? On its specs under the power section it says ""50/60Hz""..?"
69914,best major to study in college,"Just do Drop Sort.

Drop Sort is an algorithm that will *always* return a sorted list in O(n). 

Drop sort is just start on the second element of the list. If the element is smaller than the previous element, drop it from the list, else move to the next element. Repeat for the entire list. You will always take n-1 operations worst case, the list will always be sorted. It is a lossy algorithm, just like Jpeg."
22518,best celebrity,Ran into Stone Cold Steve Austin outside the Toronto Skydome after WrestleMania 18. I told him he had a good match that night and he shook my hand and said “nice to meet you sir”. Seriously the only person I’ve ever been ok with calling me “sir”. I was like a 21 year old nobody at the time.

The three body problem by cixin lui
Hyperion by Dan Simmons
The handmaids tale by Margeret Atwood


These are books that I could reread every couple of years. I’d like to include Dune by Frank Herbert also."
40405,best midrange GPU,"That's still not trivial though. Is the Corvette a ""budget"" car simply because Porsches cost more, or is $57k still a lot to pay for a car? 

I simply don't see the RTX cards as ""budget"" cards. Your 570 is a budget card."
70740,best movies with a cool twist,"The first Saw movie is utterly incredible, and unfortunately got overshadowed by the quick decline in its sequels' quality."
16726,best pet for toddlers,"If you don’t mind spending some cash, Siberian cats are a wonderful, dog-like cat breed.  While no cats are truly hypoallergenic, Siberians carry far less of the protein in their saliva that you are allergic to.  I have a coworker whose husband is *deathly* allergic to cats (literally cannot be in the vicinity of a cat without an asthma attack) and they successfully own a Siberian.  Their temperament is amazing.  If I wasn’t so anti-purchasing a cat, I’d get one.  (Though obviously in your circumstances you don’t have a lot of options!)"

- Five Tribes
- Hero Realms
- Mystic Vale"
18042,best Kardashian,"I don't think Kylie is out of touch with reality. She admits she is not self-made and had a lot of help from others. The ""self-made"" thing was started entirely by Forbes."
62422,Best RPG game on PS4,"It's fantastic indeed! And with each companion having a rich, long story (that may conflict with other companions's stories), you definitely want to play it more than once!"
23879,best anime,One piece is my favorite anime/manga of all time and I strongly disagree with your opinions but you are entitled to one so I respect it and if everybody liked one thing who would be there to argue about it 🙃
43443,best ad service for mobile applications,I'm just excited is all... perhaps a little too earnest
61199,Best comedy show on Netflix,I loved her character. The Cameron Mitchell character didn't bring much to the show but Vala was a breath of fresh air.
58499,best cologne,"Also, Nautica Voyage is EXTREMELY distinctive."
3266,best webcamera,"I bought a Ryzen 7 2700x for a dedicated streaming computer and... well, long story short, it doesn't have integrated graphics. So be aware of that.

I also use this computer when rendering out video files (which I really need to do more often), and it is *substantially* faster at this task than the i7-7700k in my main/gaming rig. I did need to update the UEFI on my board, though. I was having a ton of performance and stability issues before."

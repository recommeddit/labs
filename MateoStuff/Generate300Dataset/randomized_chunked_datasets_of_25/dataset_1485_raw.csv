"This is what I do. Also, if I have to fly somewhere and I expect to need a suit, I'd prefer that it not get lost. If my luggage gets lost, I can buy a new toothbrush. I can't just buy a fitted suit from Walgreens."
Best decision hands down 🙌

"*The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business* is hands down the greatest book about habit forming that I've ever read. It includes a multiple of examples that are both relatable and inspiring, and concise explanation about why habit building works."
"If you're a guy - Guitar. (Piano for some more refined ladies)
If you're a girl - The Skin Flute. Works every time."
"Not certified on particular hardware, software vendors don't test extensively on it, software isn't certified for it in general and the support and engineering isn't as good as RHEL."

"Okay.  A lesbian explained this to me quite clearly.  Women look at fingernails for these reasons: 

*  it's a general indicator of hygiene.  A man with clean fingernails probably brushes all his teeth and washes regularly.  
*  If things go well, those nails will probably touch her nether regions.  If they're dirty or snaggled, you may as well be kicking off foreplay with a used cat litter litter scoop.  
*  Trimmed and buffed nails are a sign of health, and an indicator or virility.  People with fragile nails don't have enough fat in their diets, nails can indicate exposure to certain toxins.... 
*  Few people are conscious of it, but there's a reason jewelry salespeople get manicures.  People subconsciously favor this without realizing it.  
*  This is classist, but people with rough, mangled hands are treated as less-thans because of the association with physical labor.  Your woodworking hobby can cost you career advancement opportunities because you give handshakes like you work on a crab boat.  A smooth handshake sends the message that you should be paid what you're worth.  

I've been a carpenter's assistant and I play guitar.  My fingertips are like little concrete pads most days, and I own an awesome manicure kit and keep them in check."

"I have tried all of them! And there are actually 36 flavors. Ice creams had to be made according to modern allergens, (dairy free, gluten free, nut free, etc.) so the 31 Flavors isn't so true anymore. 

My top three have to be:
1. Snickers
2. Nutty Coconut 
3. Love Potion No. 31
but I love Butter Pecan and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (too many choices!)."
I was sleep deprived when I saw Shutter Island in theaters and it had quite an effect
Second this!
"Grainger, hands down.  Since they’ve stopped only selling wholesale, I’ve gotten so much stuff there.  Their catalogue is huge and turnaround on orders is quick."
"Yeah, they’re completely different meds haha. One blocks histamine receptors, one blocks an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (if you need that much detail).  
If you only have a mild reaction (like a rash) to a medication, antihistamines are actually a great way to calm it down a little bit. Obviously if he starts having trouble breathing you should get to an ER."
Totally agree. Season 1 was one of my favorites in television history

"Hey there, I have an Artisan Zero Soft that I actually got off of Amazon. It is one hundred percent legit but I guess you have to check the reviews and all that to make sure. That being said, I think some other options I've seen recommended around here are the Razer Gigantus V2 and the X-Ray Pad Aqua Control+?"

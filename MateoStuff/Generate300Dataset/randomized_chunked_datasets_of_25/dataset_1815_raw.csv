"Practical effects. They cars, desert, action, stunts, and explosions all happened in real life and were shot on camera. Of course there is some green screen, but the vast majority of that movie was filmed. I think it's easy for people to forget how much work needs to go into making action of that caliber.

"True, that."
"Oh my god, you're right. I can't believe how many times I've agreed to living in, around, or not in upstate New York. I don't even know what it means."

Well then take a nap and then FIRE ZE MISSILES!!!"
"If you've never heard ""Hardcore History,"" a podcast by Dan Carlin, I highly recommend it: http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive

He has a series on Germany's WWII Eastern front called ""Ghosts of the Ostfront"" that really opened my eyes to some of the things that happened there.

His series on the Punic wars is also very good."

This is a fun game until you realize the devs will continue to move benchmarks and nerf the characters you worked hard for to encourage spending. Its a cash grab sadly.

"I have the Pandas, they sound great (not life changing or anything), but I wouldnt recommend them.  The firmware is buggy as hell, and they are prone to serious issues because of a cheap bluetooth reciever& shoddy batteries.  I've been through three already since November.  Their only saving grace is customer service will send you a new one at the drop of a hat. Tney are also extremely heavy and have practically no headband padding, which makes them extremely uncomfortable if you wear them for more than an hour.  Extra padding is hit or miss because nothing sticks to them (nuggets wont work) and the headband barely extends far enough to accomodate them anyway, so if you have a big head they won't extend far enough to fit."

"Red, White and Royal Blue is fantastic! I’m excited to put Kulti on my list now too. Seems like a lot of love for it. 💜"
I will make sure to include colour-blind friendly versions in the next installment.
Sensodyne is amazing. I have a tooth that I wore out close to the gum line from brushing to hard. Super temperature sensitive. My dental hygienist recommended sensodyne during a cleaning. I haven’t had an issue with sensitivity since I started using it!
"I mean, they don't though. https://www.amazon.com/Desktop-with110-Degree-Digital-Microphone-Recording/dp/B082CJPNB5

I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower. I sell these kinds of things all the time, usually people just check out a Logitech and see the good ones for $100 and think that's what they need to spend for something good, but cheap out and buy some unmarked thing. There's a middle ground, and they're perfect for video conferencing."
That and my dentist told me it hastens gum erosion.
"> I felt so bad for my pup, but you can’t do much about the kids these days. 

Erm, yes you can. Tell them ""do not touch my dog"" and walk away."

55911,best action and adventure movie,Great movies but they came out 15 years ago
13123,best gifts for mom,"Time:  it can be very lonely when home with an infant. Even better if you watch the baby so she can nap.

Frozen meals.

Cute hair accessories, a pretty (but comfy) cardigan."
31512,best hotel to live in,"This. The location and property is absolutely stunning! Would go back there in a heartbeat. 

It’s worth visiting even just to have lunch on a coastal drive day trip."
62083,Best RPG game on PS4,If you haven’t tried it yet it’s one of the best choices for you
8558,best toothpaste,What does the fourth friends suggest? Mountain Dew?
66996,best soccer team in the world,Can't decide between Pep's Barca and Enrique's Barca.
15935,best sunglasses for fashion,"On the other hand, I've been using my €5 random sunglasses for years, whereas my brand sunglasses always broke"
47276,best state to visit in the United States,"New Orleans, Chicago, Austin, Denver, Portland/Seattle.   Visit those 6, and you will get a good feel for real America.   
  
NY is a global city.   Not truly American culture, and more a melting pot.    LA is not a fun city to visit.   It is so spread out, you spend most of your time driving which is not fun on a holiday.   
   
Vegas is Americans and foreigners getting drunk in nightclubs and sitting by the pool or gambling.   You can have the same experience almost anywhere in the world.   
   
Go to Chicago to see a big American city.   Lots of culture with museums, sports,  it is better for holidaying than other similarly sized US metro's as it has public transport.   
   
Denver is at the foot of the rockies, so you can spend some time in the mountains.   It also has it's own western culture which can be interesting.   
   
Austin is Texan culture, and a live music home.   Everyone should experience Texas at least once in their life.   
   
New Orleans is a great party town.   Get drunk, try some of the local food.  It is everything Vegas pretends to be, but is genuine.   
   
The pacific northwest (Portland and Seattle) are really friendly cities to visit, and different from the rest of the US.   In some ways they feel more European."
46018,best trick or treating candy,"Most people at my job leave other people's stuff alone. I don't mean leave out as in a candy bowl, I mean we don't have desks and people leave the stuff they're snacking on at the water cooler. The only thing people get so tempted by that they think no one will notice if they take a few (and inevitably more and more until half the bag is gone because they keep going back) is Werthers and Jolly Ranchers."
34574,best NFL player,"He's right there, but I would guess it would be because sacks aren't everything for that position (and all time lists are skewed due to the recency of logging them). For instance, Kevin Greene is 3rd all time in sacks and he was a solid player but nowhere near sniffing these lists. And while Strahan was much better than Greene and one of the best ever at getting after the quarterback, it's a pretty loaded position for the top 100 and he was never seen as the ""bigger than life"" type of game changer like LT or Reggie White or even Bruce Smith. 


I think there's a very strong argument to be in the 90-100 range though. But just missing top 100 ever in a sport with as many positions as football, especially when trying to contextually include players from pre 1960s, isn't a bad thing."
13218,best gifts for mom,"Ha! I understand that. My mom flipped when my dad bought her a kitchen utility as a gift one year. Here I am thinking ""huh, that's practical, I would love that!"", but her, she lost her damn mind."
23796,best car racing video game,Horizon 2 or Forza 6. Although I will say if they ever brought back a true Gran Turismo experience then that would have a very good shot at dethroning Forza. I still think GT3 is the best racer ever made and there is no reason why we shouldn't have had a racing game at that level by now.
4535,best text editor,"Vim (more precisely neovim) and Emacs are my weapon of choice.

Basically, I'm using neovim for coding and Emacs for administrative tasks. It's a weird mix that I organically grew into."
46277,best trick or treating candy,"porch light on = giving candy, 

I personally turn my porch light off and sit inside drinking so if any kids knock on the door I can answer in my boxers with a beer in hand and ask them what they want.  teaches the little fuckers some etiquette."
43580,best items under $100,"No doubt, whoever is behind a vehicle, and somehow hits the back of another vehicle -  unless you have complete total confirmation and visual proof, you will always be found at fault. Which is why the current situation I’m in is so stupid. The woman switched lanes right on top of me, and I had no room and very little time to even throw on the brakes. 

And I just hadn’t gotten the dash cam up yet. Life is stupid like that sometimes."
65429,best phone service company,"Shouldn't the AT&T Prepaid $25 plan include 8 GB of data w/ rollover? In this chart, it says ""No"" under Data and priority. Error?

I'm also surprised that it doesn't make your list of best-ofs; how could it not? $25 for unlimited talk, text, and 8 GB of data (with no cap, just throttling after), and data rollover (monthly cap)?"
1559,best ice cream flavor,"I tried making that once, but it didn't turn out well. Basically I just ended up with a cold oily mush. 

Is there some trick to getting it right?"

52154,best iphone case,"A lot of votes for Spigen, thanks"
41804,movies like Inception,I haven't seen The Cell in at least a decade! I need to watch it again.
66545,best soccer team in the world,The results were mediocre at the start but it’s the best football we’ve played in the last 5 years.
33706,best electric car,"Fair enough, a lot of folks have complaints with Tesla service. I've never had to work with them as my 3 has had no issues (though it's only 7 months old and has 9k miles, it better not have had issues). 

The Bolt is likely what I'm going to try to get my parents into when their C-Max Energi lease is up. I love the Niro EV far more than the Kona, but Asian cars are instant nos from them."
4578,best text editor,I have shit in my current .emacs file older than anyone born after 1996 👴
50703,best rap album,"don’t know how you can say j cole has the worst album no matter what the hype or promotion was like..

you can love or hate j cole.. but objectively speaking that album is one of the best of the year hands down.."

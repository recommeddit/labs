52797,"Just different? Fine, I'll accept that, BUT don't call it hip hop. It is NOT hip hop. It is an entirely new genre. They can't even rap. There is no substance to their lyrics, and they obly talk about drugs, sex, money, designer clothes, and cars that cost more than a house. They all use the same old tired triplet rhythm. I grew up in the 90s when rapping about your material wealth became a thing, but the main difference is: they could actually rap, AND they had the decency to call it rap instead of hip hop. They knew it was a new genre altogether.",best hiphop album

16480,"I've worked for an eye doctor for almost seven years and sunglasses are my jam! Maui Jim is known for having amazing lens clarity. Stylistically, there's not a huge difference between Ray-Ban and Maui Jim frames. You really can't go wrong with a classic wayfarer or aviator. The trend is definitely moving toward rounder styles, I would imagine that will be in for a while. I wouldn't recommend Oakley in this case, they tend to be very sporty/trendy and look dated sooner than other brands. No matter what you go with, I would suggest trying them on and buying them in a brick and mortar store so you get a great fitting pair and can go back for adjustments. Hold onto your receipts because they usually come with a warranty!",best sunglasses for fashion

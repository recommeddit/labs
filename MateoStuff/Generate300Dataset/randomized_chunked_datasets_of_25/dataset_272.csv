34087,best NFL player,"I was glib, but he was great while in SF then was average-good the rest of his career.

So he broke most of those records due to being consistently good enough to be a starter for so long."

**EDIT:** as others have mentioned the Warranty is worth it alone.

"" Our unconditional lifetime guarantee is simple. If our socks are not the most comfortable, durable and best fitting socks you have ever owned, return them for another pair. No strings. No conditions. Socks guaranteed for life. ""

**Double EDIT**: a friend returned some that he bought on Amazon, wore out incredibly fast. DT told him they were actually counterfeit and gave him a credit to buy some real ones from their store."

Drop zones worth going to between LA and SF are Taft (great fun jumping scene), santa Barbara (less fun jumpers, but a fun dz nonetheless), skydance and skydive California - These two are the top drop zones in northern california. Byron Bay is also a good dz. Have fun! Cheers"

34647,best NFL player,"Here goes my rant: I hate these lists. They reduce careers, teams and games into cogs in the ""Where does \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ rank all time?"" debate. These guys played different positions on different teams with different schemes in different eras with different rules under different coaches for different lengths of time with different injuries. Comparing them is literally impossible.

Can't we just watch and appreciate the games without these pointless ""GOAT"" arguments?"

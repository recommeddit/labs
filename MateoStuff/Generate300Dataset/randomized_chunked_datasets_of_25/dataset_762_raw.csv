I had to scroll too far to find this
"Chop that down. 

I’d build a frame and then plant Espalier Apple, pear and plum trees. You won’t get winter cover but you can make lovely pies for all your neighbours. 

Also I find naked gardening soon inspires neighbours to plant evergreens or screens."
I swear that cologne is my weakness. SO GOOD.
"I enjoyed the Mars Trilogy a lot, but it certainly dragged a bit here and there. I absolutely LOVED Aurora, the concept was totally new to me and the character and world building was just great too. I really enjoyed the personification of the AI and yes, good robots are way less scary! 

I've worked as the facilities engineer in the Antarctic program and I feel like the problems with keeping a multi-generational interstellar spaceship running are shockingly relatable to keeping an antarctic station running through a winter. I think his Antarctica book captures life down there better than some documentaries I've seen. 

Edited my first post: Whoops, 2312!"

Just ordered one of these yesterday! It arrives in 5 days and I couldn’t be more excited
Howard Stern talks about this book on many occasions. I bought it and it really has stood up to his hype.
I have the Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear case and the Razer Arctech Pro case. Good enough for me currently. 😎👍🏼
"UT Austin, GA Tech, Purdue, UIUC, UW Seattle, and UCSD to me are easily T30 for STEM. Their outcomes reflect that too, though. They all place excellently into grad school, UW/UCSD more than the others place excellently into medical school. 

All great, highly similar schools."
Why not just set it to need before greed?
"Haha I’m strangely on board with your list. I don’t know about having Big Daddy Kane’s record all the way up there but yeah. I would swap out for Midnight Marauders probably. 

And all you have is New York! I would tend to throw Aquemini in there. Also at this point I have to say Good Kid Maad City."
"I was about to post this link when I found yours. Watch top link for sure, OP."
"I once shotgunned (not the whole thing) a 4loko. Cherry flavored, it sprayed the ceiling and when it dried it wasn't pink anymore."
Turkey Hill fudge ripple specifically! It was the brand Angel Food when I was a kid in the 80s - 90s. Turkey Hill bought out.
"I think I'm going to actually have to buy one of these.  

I was approaching a toll booth about a month ago, when a woman who was behind me in my lane sped around me, and then merged into my side.  The guy who had been behind her said I was the one who merged into her.  So now I have to cover my own repair and hers, just because some random dude climbed out of the woodwork and hadn't been paying attention to what was going on.

A dashcam seems like it could have prevent all of this."
Damn I haven’t thought about that “Can’t Be Touched” song for years. That’s a dope ass song both for workout or just a good hype song. Thanks for the memories.

"I get Smart water only for the bottle. It's sturdy, has a really simple design (both with shape and graphics), and it has the best nipple. I'll get one and just reuse it for a few weeks until it starts to wear down. It's perfect."
"It's an _important_ paper. But I don't see how it's a great paper in-itself. By today's standards, it probably wouldn't get published, and for some good reasons: 

Crick and Watson weren't reporting any new experimental results, or any new theoretical results (such as some calculations from spectrscopic data), or even a detailed theory from which they made any predictions. It's just an opinion. In short, ""This is what we think the DNA molecule looks like"", based mainly on other people's unpublished results. Of course it's short and easy to read; it's basically a long ""discussion"" section of a paper, rather than an actual paper.

Today, at the very least they'd have to write a review or something to be able to state an opinion without evidence. You're not going to get a _Nature_ publication out of ""Other people's unpublished results suggest to us that it's like this""."

"Most dog owners are gone from 8-5, for the record. My pets are alone for 10+ hours a day, but they have each other (and are incredibly bonded) so they do fine. I don't love doing this, but we don't have much of an option. We both have to work and my commute is 50+ minutes a day.

This is normal, very few people that have dogs and full-time jobs can get around this. It's about the time you have in the mornings/evenings/weekends to spend time with them that makes the difference. Also the age of the animal is crucial, getting a puppy is NOT advisable. 

My wife and I even foster dogs for a local rescue and those dogs very quickly adjust to the 8-5 schedule, but we play hard in the evenings and avoid puppies.

If you don't want to get a dog, I would recommend a cat, but not a kitten. A young rescue who isn't timid would do well with a toddler."
You guys are definitely directors/visual directors. I hear this all the time.
"Steve1989. Dude is super passionate about military rations. Also for car guys Doug demuro, petrolicious, and seen through glass"
My associates is in general studies. I changed my major so many times that my advisor just pooled my credits together and told me to show up in may for graduation.

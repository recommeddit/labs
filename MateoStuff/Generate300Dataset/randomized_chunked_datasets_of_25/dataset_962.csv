33873,"I recommend the following: 
Fire/red/leafgreen (can be played on DS lite), followed by heartgold/soulsilver, platinum, emerald (original), followed by the other pokemon games in order of release (Black/white, black/white2)

If you don't want to jump between graphics of newer/older games move emerald (original) to immediately after firered/leafgreen 

Honestly, I absolutely adore Gen 1-4 and I would STRONGLY recommend for any pokemon fan to experience Gen 1-4 
A lot of people say Gen 5 has the best story but Gen 5 is my probably least fav. gen and I really hated the pokemon designs of this gen. It was the only gen where I hated the starter pokemon (but I will admit the story is interesting and the game has a good difficulty level)

Gen 6 (X/Y) felt weak to me and story was too short, the game was too easy, the evil team lacked any charm to make them memorable. Honestly, you could completely skip this gen and it would make zero difference but if your a hardcore fan, you'll probably still come back to play X/Y...actually, looking at everything as a whole, I would rank Gen 6 as the lowest, and Gen 5 slightly above it for having an engaging story and large amount of post-game content 

Final note: it would probably be really difficult to get your hands on a legit copy of firered/leafgreen and emerald now so BEWARE OF FAKE GAMES 

EDIT: If you can't get your hands on firered/leafgreen/emerald immediately, start with platnium. You can also play heartgold/soulsilver BUT won't understand all the references without playing Gen 1 (firered/leafgreen)",best Pokemon game

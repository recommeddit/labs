13397,"I work with large spreadsheets as well. I don't like the concept of ""power users"" for Microsoft Excel; the truth is that there are very few people who are true power users (I.e. have the ability to write macros and create code to support programming through Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications). 

I had similar problems using Microsoft Excel for Mac until I increased my RAM to 8 GB.  Microsoft Excel for Mac is very unwieldy code in order to provide support for legacy features and functionality including and especially Visual Basic for Applications.

Microsoft really screwed Mac users by deprecating Visual Basic for Applications integration with Microsoft excel for Mac.  

In the case of macros I have used AppleScript to re-create some of the functionality of Visual Basic for Applications integrated with Microsoft Excel for Mac.  

In the case of pivot tables, Apple Numbers offers table categories which is not quite the same but can reproduce similar functionality without the overhead of running Microsoft Jet database engine.

The only real issue with Apple Numbers is a much smaller user base resulting in a much smaller community to offer off-the-shelf macros and scripts. The truth is that few people have really explored the capabilities of macros and scripts and Apple Numbers regardless of what they might have you believe.",best spreadsheet editor

You can't live in a world of absolutes, where good guys win and bad guys lose, because in politics, everyone is a bad guy to someone, and most are a good guy to someone else.  He was a realist in that he would work with what he had, and an idealist because no one believed what he wanted was possible.",best politician

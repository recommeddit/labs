61830,"Hate to tell you this but you never completed 1 full playthrough. You completed route A, but you still have route B and route C and endings D and E. That is classified as a full playthrough. 

It saddens me that so many people like OP put the game down after seeing the credits for route A. They don't realise they only played a third of the game.

If you have any questions incase your confused about how to play the game don't hesitate to ask and I can provide more detail",Best RPG game on PS4

Replacing it around three or four times a year sounds about right.  The light doesn't matter too much, I used my last filter until the water poked a hole through it and it started spraying my ceiling.",best water filter

16243,"Folks, just be careful with “cheap” sunglasses that do not legitimately protect your eyes. 

Our eyes squint to protect them from harmful UV rays. When you wear glasses that do not protect your eyes, the shades will prevent you from squinting...and your eyes will be more exposed to those harmful rays.

For the past 15 years, I’ve liked [Smith](https://www.smithoptics.com/us/) aviators. Not part of the monopoly, legitimate polarized protection, and good quality if you take care of them $99-$125.

In terms of great price point to quality, you can check out [Goodr](https://goodr.com) $25-$35.",best sunglasses for fashion

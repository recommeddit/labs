Cheap Mexican: El Zarape and Super Cucas are both cheap and great. El Zarape also offers a bit more variety if you're adventurous. Super Ricas is good, but there is a ton of hype around it thanks to Julia Childs (her recommendation was totally overblown). You can always expect a large crowd of tourists and locals at Super Ricas, but the previous joints pretty much only cater to locals. 

Asian food: You're SOL for the most part. No place is down right awful, but don't expect super high-quality, super accurate food. Sushi-Teri on Bath and Szechuan on Cliff come to mind.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara

3694,"It's a tough thing to visualise, if you think about it.

Sure, there are problems with this current viz, as you stated, but I can't think of any other method to present this data in a way which retains its realism.

Sure, you could do some kind ""top 1000 universities as a proportion of population"", or some kind of hexagonal grid like ""top 1000 universities per n km"", or give each orange dot its own space so that none overlap...

...but I think it would become completely abstracted to the point of unreadability.

In truth, it's the 'fault' of reality that the top 1000 universities *just are* in the most developed urban centers, not the fault of this viz.",best college for research

Maybe because some of the songs/products are so odd, or because the ""main character"" was a comedy writer for David Letterman, I spent the first half convinced it was all a windup.  A very interesting topic/piece of Americana I knew nothing about before watching and left really appreciating everyone involved.  It's on Netflix too I believe.",best Netflix documentary

Over four years I went in-state, did Community College for 1.5 years to get the 'basic' classes out of the way cheaper, and then went hard for the nest 2.5 years. I ended up with about $35K in loans that I will be done paying off this December, basically 15 years early. I also paid about 15% more each month than the minimum to eat the principal away quicker.

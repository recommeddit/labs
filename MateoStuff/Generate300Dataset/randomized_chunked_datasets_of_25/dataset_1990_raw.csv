"They don't have those in the land of Guns, God, and Covid.  But we do have the Spark EV which is supposed to kick entirely too much ass for what it is."
It’s a carry-on bag.
"Might I also suggest reading this as well, as it is quite relevant, and I believe that Waterhouse *et al.* made significant contributions to the field before Fire and Mellos paper. http://www.pnas.org/content/95/23/13959.full.pdf"

No Arthur c Clarke?
"Turkey Hill has this ice cream called double dunker. It is love, it is life. If it were a man or woman I would gladly make sweet sensual love to it to the calming sounds of Barry Manelow. It has coffee flavored ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough chunks and Oreo mother fucking swirl. If you haven't tried it start living. Get a pallet. Then go out into the world and be forever known as the guy who fucks because you'll have a grin the size of Texas on your face and you probably won't be able to walk straight afterwards. Welcome to manhood, Shirley"

"A decent pair of shoes on clearance. Nice shoes, like Eccos, that are good for your feet. You might not think about it, but your feet and how you treat them are crucial for the health of you ankles, knees, hips and back. You're standing on those mfs all the time. They work hard for you, so get good shoes!

Does Houston play at Pittsburgh this year?  Those fans could think up something with the terrible towels lmao"
"Guess so! I feel silly for giving real advice on things I know about instead of judging everyone! Seems to be the cool trend 😜

Oh and I love Disney!! Maybe because I’m Spanish and go there once in a million years and everything is so pretty and happy!! Yep... maybe you’re right and it is not very real..."
"Predestination. It's a great film that is very underrated, imo."
"Grid Autosport. Good graphics, nice tracks, nice cars and cool AI.

"Not in the US, but still good info. Thanks!"
One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. It's so good.
"Seriously, stop pawning off your trash to everyone else, cuz I guarantee they're not going down to the store stocking up on AAs.  Those bitches dead, found under the couch or absentmindedly picked up, looked at, ""hmm, was wondering where it went"", put in their pocket, then hastily put in a baggy because they forgot about Halloween till the last minute"
"Oh yeah..completely forgot his name!

Edited. Thank you mate :-)"

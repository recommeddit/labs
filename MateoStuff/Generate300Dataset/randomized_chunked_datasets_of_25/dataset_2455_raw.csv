"maybe because you mentioned it and asked about alternatives

BTW BC2 sucks, I use for years Business Calendar Pro 1.x, hands down no competition and I tried all calendar apps

for starters repeated reminders and condensed/compact agenda view are killer features, also own fast numerical keyboard to enter time

everything else looks like coloring book for toddlers next to BCP1 including BC2, if you mean business BCP1 it's the only option"

I’ve heard that cheap/fake sunglasses that don’t block UV rays are more damaging as your irises open up due to the shade of the glasses and therefore take in more harmful UV rays which do not get blocked by the fake lenses. How true is that?
"Same. I own 5 on this list. One of those I just bought yesterday (Azul), and 2 others I have yet to play. But I own em..."
That's because they put salt in it. One time I got a bottle that I guess had gotten more salt than usual because it actually tasted like straight up sea water. That was when I looked at the ingredients and found out they put salt in it. I refuse to drink dasani ever since then.
Super Hexagon. I've bought it on Android AND iOS. Twice. (Made a US account when my country had the worst catalogue. Then I got a new phone and couldn't use the US account.)
"That's excellent.

A bag with a warrantee on zippers and seams is definitely worth looking for."
GABANA tho 😂😂😂👍
Wasn't it considered the second most prestigious European trophy?
New vamp masquerade game coming next year btw
"I would have been fine with hubby calling about the sippy cups. What kills it is coming home to find that the only thing he's done is keep the baby alive - the house is a wreck (worse than you left it), he can't remember when the baby last ate or got changed, etc."
"Fair. But unlike say, avoiding a first year Apple product (which I always do) avoiding a first year EV means waiting probably 4-5 years before anything suitable comes out."
"i've been following them since their first release, their growth has been truly astounding, i can only begin to imagine where they'll keep going since these albums were written around the same time period. 



Bossa Nova and Self Destruct are my favorite things they've done yet, i think they're gonna be major players in pushing punk music forward and renewing wider interest in it with that level of chemistry and songwriting"
"Most use mirrorless cameras now, but DSLRs work as well. Also most camera manufacturers support video over USB. Your PC sees the camera as a webcam."
"Hi, sadly and somewhat ridiculously no, I gave up and got rid of the tablet.

I tried [OpenBoard](https://openboard.ch/index.en.html) for a while but the UI was just too awkward to use efficiently.

However, according to this [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/2815#event-5064831912) for [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/), they may have fixed the problem  with pressure sensitivity, so that may be a good one for you to try now. Seemed like a decent app otherwise, when I tried it."
"So far, I'm fairly certain it's all generations. First gen Xbox, 360, and One games can all be played on the new one that's coming out iirc"

"""Its now blind and its angry."" LOL great commentary"
"I have, and while I very much enjoyed the experience and all, it just didn't ""grip"" me as much, emotionally-speaking; it felt smoother and more luxurious than a comparable ICE car becaus of the drivetrain (quieter and smoother), but that's kinda the problem for me; the car needs to be at least a *little* raw and mechanical, and the EV drivetrain made the car feel like an electric go-kart, kinda video-game like, which made me feel a bit... ""removed"" from the driving experience. 

The power delivery was instant and predictable (1 gear ratio
 and all that), but in spite of the objective boon of the electric performance it just... I dunno; for the purpose of fun, there's something (to me) about the rising and falling noise of the engine and the satisfaction of a perfect shift."
Word. I feel like the only exception for me is something like a very depressing documentary that's good at teaching you but not very good at entertaining you. Ex: Dear Zachary
"Menards does profit sharing with their employees, so I've always liked them a little more for that."
Dann kommst du wohl vom grossen Kanton im Norden 😂
"its temporary, maybe a couple days."
Ya I love it. You def need to go in order though cause they all use things from the previous books
Will do that today.

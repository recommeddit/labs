16249,"I love my Kent Wang sunglasses. I’ve had probably half a dozen pairs by now. I think they’re around 50 bucks, constructed with high quality acetate frames, great polarized lenses, and durable spring-relief hinges. I’m consistently impressed by the great quality, considering that I know what people are paying for (IMO inferior quality) raybans, etc",best sunglasses for fashion
7530,"I've researched the list of laptops below in hopes of finding a good gaming laptop. However, I always seem to just find all of the negative comments. The only conclusion I could think to come to is these are all terrible, but I don’t think thats the case. 

Looking for some help trying to find a good gaming laptop. Budget is $2500, if the laptop is not maxed for specs I would like it to be upgradable. Also, I know nothing about AMD, but willing to go that route. Any assistance would be appreciated.

Blues are my favorite to type because of the sound... but they're loud enough that honestly I get self conscious using blues in a room where there are other people trying to do things that involve their ears.

So brown are probably my favorite overall.",best keyboard switches
